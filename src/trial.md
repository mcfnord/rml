# The parties

My story began in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico over ten years ago,
but you can skip ahead to 2013, when it was clear my friend
would die. In December, I came to Tacoma to care for her as she did,
and to give our daughter everything we could through the crisis.
I had no idea what hostile and underhanded forces laid in wait for me.

# The custody dispute

# See The alleged crime

It meant the world to 
step out to a New Year's party with good friends. I got wild
singing about the hard year behind me, and good one ahead.
I barely remember the deed Lindquist called a crime.
I have no dispute it was a very bad idea, but was never a crime.
I chose the wrong words. In a career of trying to choose the right ones,
I chose the wrong ones, not based on my meaning, but based on how
they could be interpreted differently.

# Scary police reports

It takes some work to translate a Facebook post into an arrest warrant.
Three people who said they were my victims worked hard to get to that
point. Two were dishonest, and one was just in way over her head.

# TV news

I walked into my job in downtown Seattle on Tuesday. Nobody noticed
I had missed Monday, and nobody even saw the news broadcast. For a time,
I occupied both the realm of Seattle high-tech, and the realm of Pierce County's accused.

# Live on bail



# See The recall effort

Try to imagine my surprise when I'm out on bail and learn that citizens have accused 
Lindquist of serious offenses in office, most notably an unhealthy pattern of going on TV to 
talk about people accused of crimes. In my own county (King), the prosecutor might be visible 
after a conviction--after all his work culminates in a persuaded jury. In legal terms, the 
difference between public statements about the accused vs. the convicted is a huge one. My 
family quickly joined the movement to remove Lindquist. My mom may have gathered a hundred 
signatures in her gated retirement community alone.

I've often reflected that America gives many elected officials 4 years to screw up. We rarely 
remove officials during their term. Rather, we just find someone better at the next election. 
Recalls are notoriously complicated to achieve, and I admire how hard so many worked at this 
high goal. While the recall effort didn't get adequate signatures to proceed, it did get a 
judge's blessing, a critical step the law requires to affirm that in fact it is very likely 
the official committed acts that merit removal from office. Since then, the evidence has 
grown stronger and louder.

# SCOTUS and me

Being out on bail is surreal. Being on bail for a speech crime
was another level. Anything I say anywhere could be used against me.
My lawyer explained that even clicking Like on Facebook could be used
against me somehow. I knew Lindquist's office

My case was very unusual. People in civil court often love the idea of involving the 
prosecutor. It can give a huge advantage to their lot in civil court when they opposing party 
is in jail, or silent due to their Fifth Amendment right to be so. Any sound prosecutor would 
see bright yellow flags when a party in a civil case insists they're victims of a crime 
perpetrated by their opponent. But this prosecutor went on TV, and I believe that prevented 
him from ever having a come-to-Jesus moment about the quality of his case.

# Lindquist doubles down

I remember the deputy prosecutor looking at me intensely after piling on the 
charges on the day the trial began. I didn't understand how we had come from 
Lindquist on television saying there was an actual investigation, to this 
point where a rational man would conclude an actual investigation was 
concluded, and as a result, my act was deemed even worse than it appeared at 
the initial arraignment. You would think actual investigation yield actual 
results, a deeper understanding, and a refinement of focus. With Lindquist, 
you would be wrong. Having been accused of terrible crimes against a child, I 
already had an enormous report prepared by Washington's top expert in violent 
criminals. He unequivocally declared that I'm a harmless person. An enormous 
body of evidence confirmed that.

The prosecutor believed I could see over a year in prison for the deed he called a crime.

She was removed from the custody case because she failed her client.

She said she got two or three guns.
She must have read 200 pages of hostile accusations against me.
Nowhere in any was there any accusation of violence.
But I think she got whipped up by the excitement of a police investigation.
The court confirmed that she was inappropriately involved when they removed her.

Recording of Heather Young.
On the witness stand, she estimated her fear of me
as "a 4 out of 5". but here's her voice at the time
of the alleged crime:

This can't be the first time aa party in civil court
has tried to use the Prosecutor's office to engage
the counter-party. Prosecutors are supposed to see
through this behavior. Mark Lindquist did not,
or he did, but knew his appearance on television
would risk yet another bar complaint for yet another
TV apperance where he violates the Rules of 
Professional Conduct.

Over a long weekend in jail, I met so many men who have nowhere near the resources I and my family could muster against Lindquist's opposition.

I didn't prevail. The sharpest fact in my failure was the time of Emily's death.
Had she lived another six months, I would be in Pierce County, doing everything
Emily asked me to do there.

# See The future

This experience was informative. I always had a healthy skepticism about the clarity of 
claims made to a court, and by law enforcement on television. Now I know for a certainty that 
some officials make deeply misleading statements, and once made, must stand by their words to 
the bitter end. Lindquist has followed this pattern through more controversies than my own. 
In government, just as in commerce, we are as good as our leaders. There's no magic that 
keeps terrible decisionmakers out of power. Terrible people often seek power. Some people 
think it's their birthright, to rule, even without accountability. Democracy's 
tools--including institutions like an independent court, a free press, standards for lawyers 
enforced by the Bar Association, and regular elections--are society's mechanisms to remove 
terrible leaders. There's absolutely no guarantee these tools will work, but they are the 
best we have.
