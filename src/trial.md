Recording of Heather Young.
On the witness stand, she estimated her fear of me
as "a 4 out of 5". but here's her voice at the time
of the alleged crime:

This can't be the first time aa party in civil court
has tried to use the Prosecutor's office to engage
the counter-party. Prosecutors are supposed to see
through this behavior. Mark Lindquist did not,
or he did, but knew his appearance on television
would risk yet another bar complaint for yet another
TV apperance where he violates the Rules of 
Professional Conduct.
