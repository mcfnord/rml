Today I provided a Bar Complaint to the Bar 
Association. I suspect every court case is complex, 
and I thought it would help to provide additional 
details to help you understand how things came about.

# The parties

My story began in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico over ten 
years ago. Maybe it began the day I took this picture:

... but you can skip ahead to 2013, when it was clear 
my friend would die. In December, I came to Tacoma to 
care for her as she did, and to give our daughter 
everything we could through the crisis. I had no idea 
what hostile and underhanded forces laid in wait for 
me.

# The custody dispute

My friend and I did everything we could to assure her 
daughter would be raised according to her wishes. But 
my friend's father did everything he could legally 
do--and then some--to subvert her wishes. You can 
study the insane custody court battle that ensued.

# The alleged crime

It meant the world to step out to a New Year's party 
with good friends. I got wild singing about the hard 
year behind me, and good one ahead. I barely remember 
the deed Lindquist called a crime. I have no dispute 
it was a very bad idea, but was never a crime. I chose 
the wrong words. In a career of trying to choose the 
right ones, I chose the wrong ones, not based on my 
meaning, but because they could be interpreted 
differently. It was incredibly late when I wrote seven 
words and fell asleep.

# Scary police reports

It takes some work to translate a Facebook post into 
an arrest warrant. Three people who said they were my 
victims worked hard to get to that point. Two were 
dishonest, and one was just in way over her head.

# "Rounded him up"

As you see in [the Bar Complaint](bc.html), one Friday 
at lunch I learned I was a wanted man. As I explain in 
that Complaint, I was incredibly cooperative with the 
authorities. I considered not leaving Seattle that 
Friday, knowing a Friday arrest means a weekend in 
jail. I resent very much the way Mark Lindquist 
ignored my obvious cooperation when crafting his 
fantasy fiction about those events.

# Long weekend in jail

Any weekend in jail is a long one. I met some good 
people there. I felt uncomfortable walking around, and 
mostly stayed in my bunk. The mattress I had was 
terrible, and my back hurt a lot. Eventually I swapped 
it for a better one that wasn't in use.

On arraignment day, many prisoners were called to a 
side room to talk with legal assistants. I was the 
only one who explained I have retained private 
counsel.

# Arraignment

Arraignment is an exciting time for accused prisoners. 
A lot of people learn there that no charges will be 
filed against them--they're going home soon.

Arraignment is also a change of company. I had been 
kept in the non-violent area. At arraignment, I made 
the acquaintence of some scary dudes. I also remember 
a uniquely brilliant man, a mathmetician with an 
advanced degree and opioid addiction. He was highly 
respected among prisoners because he knew the 
sentencing guidelines. A prisoner could tell him his 
criminal history, and he could estimate what the 
arraignment judge would do. How much your bail will be 
is the only question anyone has for the arraignment 
judge, and this guy's obvious skill at estimating was 
very valuable to us.

As each person was called from the arraignment holding 
cell before the judge, we'd wish them success. On 
their return, we'd ask how it went. They may have just 
learned they face years in a prison, or would be going 
home soon, so the excitement was palpable, and most 
were enthusiastic to share. Two phrases common to jail 
were repeated in that pen: *some bullshit* and *it is 
what it is*.

I'll pause here to point out something you might not 
realize about jail. In my day, especially in Seattle, 
face-to-face interaction must compete with mobile 
phones showing social media and the rest of the vast 
internet. In jail, people interact, and are largely 
returned to a human's normal state of curiousity about 
others, and an eagerness to interact, even with 
strangers. I joked with the math whiz that people pay 
good money for a Buddhist retreat where there are no 
mobile devices and cable TVs.

I remember a man whose common-law wife had turned him 
in days after she says he harmed her. She was in the 
gallery at the arraignment yelling how much she missed 
him, and how she wanted him back. He explained that he 
did 19 years for a murder he didn't commit, and had 
given enough of his life to the state. I joke when I'm 
nervous, but he didn't get my jokes. I quickly 
switched to clearer, simpler speech. He was a 
physically intimidating figure. He talked about how 
much his wife drinks, and how she gets out of control 
and becomes another person. Three prisoners gathered 
close to him while the math whiz explained that his 
wife is an alcoholic, and can't control her drinking 
like many can. He said he wanted to get out of this 
country, and go to Hawaii. Nobody was going to 
quibble. We said that was a good plan.

As men returned from seeing the judge, details 
emerged. Someone noticed a television camera. Through 
lore and logic they knew there must be someone accused 
of a notorious crime. The math whiz also explained 
that a judge in front of a camera is dangerous, 
because they must appear tough for the television 
audience. Eventually, Math Whiz and I noticed everyone 
else but me had faced the judge. He eventually 
concluded, "They must be here for you. You're the 
Sacrificial Lamb!" I guess this was the hardest moment 
of my interaction with Pierce County's criminal 
justice system. Math Whiz, who was also a Seventh Day 
Adventist, quoted some theological concepts that 
brought me some comfort.

My attorney was such a square that I didn't dare wave 
or smile. In hindsight I wish I did. Anyone who knows 
me knows I'm not inclined to threats or violence, and 
would much rather make a friend. Tim Leary came to 
mind, always smiling becaue he knew the medium is the 
message. But the judge was already motivated by the 
television cameras to show dominance over the lawless 
danger she was told I represented. So I kept a stoic 
face.

To this day, I compare my bail, $75,000, or "seventy 
five racks" to that of other accused. Back in lock-up, 
this sum made me revered. I must be some criminal to 
merit that much bail, especially with no priors. One 
charismatic man invited me to share with his group 
what my crime was. "They claim I threatened to murder 
a judge!" Listeners loved this. "But I didn't do it!" 
Of course, they said. None of us did.

# Leaving jail

At the exit to the jail, an officer behind some 
plexiglass returned my personal property. I tried to 
open the door to leave, but there wasn't a handle. 
"That's kind of the point," she said. She hit the 
buzzer and I was free.

# TV news

That night my family drove me to SeaTac, where I 
lived. I saw the television broadcast on the internet 
before I left the car. Of course the music video made 
visual and scary news, when added to the false police 
reports. But Mark Lindquist's extrajudicial comments 
were icing on the cake for KIRO editors. *Considered 
me a threat. Didn't wait. Rounded me up.* What an 
illusion of efficacy he provided, a series of false 
statements, made publically at the expense of my 
reputation, and obviously endangering my right to a 
fair trial. Yeah, Champ. Yeah, Tiger. You said what 
you thought would keep your job safe. Truth was 
secondary, and you thought it was OK to risk 
everything else as collateral damage.

I walked into my job in downtown Seattle on Tuesday. 
Nobody noticed I had missed Monday, and nobody even 
saw the news broadcast. For a time, I occupied both 
the realm of Seattle high-tech, and the realm of 
Pierce County's accused.

Weeks later, a man was trying to recruit me to support 
the data analytics division of a global entertainment 
leader. He realized that he had seen me on the news. 
He said it was unlikely that I would be hired based on 
what he knew.

# The recall effort

Try to imagine my surprise when I'm out on bail and 
learn that citizens have accused Lindquist of serious 
offenses in office, most notably an unhealthy pattern 
of going on TV to talk about people accused of crimes. 
In my own county (King), the prosecutor might be 
visible after a conviction--after all his work 
culminates in a persuaded jury. In legal terms, the 
difference between public statements about the accused 
vs. the convicted is a huge one.

My family quickly joined the movement to remove 
Lindquist. My mom may have gathered a hundred 
signatures in her gated retirement community alone.

I've often reflected that America gives many elected 
officials 4 years to screw up. We rarely remove 
officials during their term. Rather, we just find 
someone better at the next election. Recalls are 
notoriously complicated to achieve, and I admire how 
hard so many worked at this high goal. And we all 
should recognize that the recall cleared the first and 
most serious hurdle: A judge agreed there was enough 
evidence to believe Mark Lindquist has committed 
offenses serious enough to merit a recall effort. 
According to that judge, it is very likely this 
official committed acts that merit removal from 
office. Since then, the evidence has grown stronger 
and louder.

[The petition contends Lindquist pays extra attention 
to criminal cases that receive media attention, and 
seeks harsher penalties for defendants in such 
cases.](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article26347357.html)

# SCOTUS and me

Being out on bail is surreal. Being on bail for a 
speech crime was another level. Anything I said 
anywhere could be used against me. My lawyer explained 
that even clicking Like on Facebook could be used 
against me somehow.

I remember how surreal it became when the Supreme 
Court ruled in my favor, in a case incredibly similar 
to my own. While the nation celebrated the marriage 
equality ruling, the SCOTUS ruling on *Alonis v. USA* 
was as significant to speech advocates. In a case much 
more heinous and much more clear, the Supremes ruled 
there was no real threat because there was no 
intention to threaten. Surely this meant the 
prosecutor would drop the charges. Had he not gone on 
TV and said those things, I bet he would have.

# Lindquist doubles down

My case was very unusual. People in civil court often 
love the idea of involving the prosecutor. It can give 
a huge advantage to their lot in civil court when they 
opposing party is in jail, or silent due to their 
Fifth Amendment right to be so. Any sound prosecutor 
would see bright yellow flags when a party in a civil 
case insists they're victims of a crime perpetrated by 
their opponent. But this prosecutor went on TV, and I 
believe that prevented him from ever having a 
come-to-Jesus moment about the quality of his case.

I remember the deputy prosecutor looking at me 
intensely after piling on the charges on the day the 
trial began. I didn't understand how we had come from 
Lindquist on television saying there was an actual 
investigation, to this point where a rational man 
would conclude an actual investigation had concluded, 
and as a result, my act was deemed even worse than it 
appeared at the initial arraignment. You would think 
actual investigation yield actual results, a deeper 
understanding, and a refinement of focus. With 
Lindquist, you'd be wrong.

Due to a flurry of wild accusations in my custody 
case, I was blessed to have met for ten hours with 
Washington's top expert in violent criminals. He is 
the coolest person I've met in a while. He 
unequivocally declared that I'm a harmless person. An 
enormous body of evidence confirmed that. Additional 
evidence from the people Mark called victims also 
pointed to flim-flam and bamboozle. But I don't think 
the facts mattered to the prosecution. I think they 
needed a conviction at any cost, because it weakened 
any claim I might make about the appropriateness of 
Mark's statements to the press. They didn't understand 
I couldn't just take a small charge, as it would 
substantially weaken my custody case.

To be accused of threatening to murder a judge I had 
only great feelings toward was particularly insulting 
and surreal. The judge had studied all the documents 
in my custody case, and ruled unequivocally that the 
opposing attorney's request was without merit. And 
Lindquist's deputy was going to argue I wanted to 
communicate a murder threat? It was insane. I found 
the judge involved to be brilliant and adorable, fully 
deserving of his esteemed position as the county's 
lead justice.

The prosecutor believed I could see over a year in 
prison for the seven words he called a crime.

# See Ridiculous trial

This can't be the first time a party in civil court 
has tried to use the Prosecutor's office to engage the 
counter-party. Prosecutors are supposed to see through 
this behavior. Mark Lindquist did not, or he did, but 
also knew if he simply dropped it, his appearance on 
television would risk yet another bar complaint for 
yet another TV apperance where he violates the Rules 
of Professional Conduct. The recall petitioners 
specified exactly that behavior as a cause for 
removal. So he didn't drop it. He threw a Hail Mary 
and lost. But how did my trial become his game? Is 
this how a prosecutor should think and behave?

Over a long weekend in jail, I met so many men who 
have nowhere near the resources I and my family could 
muster against Lindquist's television and courtroom 
smears.

## Very confused G.A.L.

She was removed from the custody case because she 
failed her client.

She said she got two or three guns. She must have read 
200 pages of hostile accusations against me. Nowhere 
in any was there any accusation of violence. But I 
think she got whipped up by the excitement of a police 
investigation. The court confirmed that she was 
inappropriately involved when they removed her.

Later she wrote this outrageously mistaken and 
insulting defense of her involvement with police:

## Dishonest dad


## Dishonest attorney

Alleged victim Heather Young's testimony illustrates 
just how bad Lindquist's case against me was. On the 
witness stand, she estimated her fear of me as "a 4 
out of 5". but here's her voice at the time of the 
alleged crime:

So as she testified, we just pressed play. You should 
have seen her face. She's no stranger to violating the 
Rules of Professional Conduct. That's how I see Pierce 
County: People like Heather Young, Saundra?, and Mark 
Lindquist cook up schemes. Most people can't confront 
them.

## My testimony

[You can read my testimony and words from my 
accusers](http://tucc.us/dtm_cop_lies.html).

Testifying wasn't fun, but it was heartening. The 
surreal accusations made no sense in the face of the 
truth. And that's my experience with Lindquist: He 
projects a bizarre and surreal set of explanations for 
things. When there's a candidate like Mary Robnett 
countering with real, clear statements of fact, it's 
heartening. "Win at all costs" seems like his tactic, 
if you can call it a tactic. I just think he's got a 
mental illness. There, I said it.

# See Before my verdict

As it happens, my parents are Pierce County Democrats 
since forever. The day before my verdict, we attended 
a Dem fundraiser in downtown Tacoma. By pure luck, my 
assigned seat faced Mark. What a surreal moment that 
was for me. He rode his phone all evening long. What a 
bizarre and insulting argument he made to our state's 
Supreme Court, that the ownership of the phone was a 
loophole in our laws governing public officials. I 
never asked any judge to believe something so 
outrageous. He spent tax funds lavishly on his 
ridiculous position. My family spent painfully to 
counter his ridiculous claim that I should be 
incarcerated. And it was a surreal culmination, to 
watch him ride his phone all evening, as a recall 
petition drive threatened him in the street, and I 
studied and derided his fat head and crazy eyes from 
fifteen feet away. He's a danger because he thinks 
only he matters. Whatever else is going on, he wants 
to make it about him. He'll put you in a prison if he 
thinks that's what it takes to keep him safely in the 
public eye.

# The verdict

Lindquist lost, rather spectactularly. The judge 
convicted me of nothing. The deputy prosecutor who 
handled every aspect of my case from the arrest 
warrant to the verdict was promoted. I guess Lindquist 
loves loyalty. Performance must come in somewhere 
lower on the list.

# See Implications of Lindquist's position

The crime Mark accused me of is a speech crime. Speech 
crimes do exist, and I got to learn all about them. 
The law calls the crime he tried me for a *true 
threat*. You know what I think: He tried me because he 
went on TV and spoke improperly about me, and had to 
win to paper over that choice. If we pretend that's 
untrue, where does that leave him? It disturbs me that 
an American would believe seven words could and should 
result in seven felonies and over a year behind bars. 
Any seven words just aren't enough to determine 
intended meaning. Next you'll see him trying someone 
for the work of a smartphone's auto-correct!

At one point, the prosecutor invited me to accept one 
misdermeanor, I think it was... I should check. And 
then invited me to specify another outcome and avoid a 
trial. I asked him to just walk away. In criminal 
court, you deal with a deputy prosecutor, but my 
attorney explained that there are no trials unless 
Mark Lindquist insists on one. Mark couldn't walk 
away. How many times have we seen that before? With 
how many obsessions, pertaining to how many abuses of 
his authority within the press and within law 
enforcement? He gets obsessed and he can't let go.

This guy, who wrote some novels, believed in 
criminalizing speech, long after it was clear the 
people who called it in were charlitans. This must 
happen to prosecutors every day. People in conflicts 
want to drop a dime on the other party, and make them 
sound terrible. I hear about it every day on the 
Seattle Police scanner. There really usually are at 
least two sides. But when you go on TV and talk out 
your ass about the accused, you can't do the right 
thing anymore, and just drop the charges. So Mark 
doubled down.

He's either prone to bungles where his mouth gets him 
in trouble, or he's all for criminalizing accidental, 
unfortunate speech, so long as some stooges will claim 
to be victims in his fantasy before a judge. One of 
those must be true.

That troubles me. When you compare my case of alleged 
(and now disproven) felony harassment to other cases, 
there's no comparison. Facts of actual felony 
harassment include details I remember, like 5 hours of 
death threat text messages, or lengthy, wordy screeds 
on email that very, very clearly say, "I will kill 
you."

As you see from my testimony at trial, my mind was 
hazy, not focused, and my thinking was metaphorical, 
not literal. One would think an "author-lawyer" would 
be the first to comprehend how this might happen, but 
he was the last.

Maybe Mark is obsessed with this particular crime. 
It's a unique kind of crime, where symbols and words 
are the actual crime. According to documents, Mark 
Lindquist [became obsessed with the idea that Glenda 
Nissen committed this same 
crime](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article26298505.html) 
by sending a death threat to Mary Robnett, even though 
no forensic evidence tied her to it, and other details 
didn't point to her, either. Maybe as a writer of pulp 
fiction, he's unusually attached to words. Perhaps. 
But really, I think it's deeper than that. I think 
Mark has the kind of connection to words and symbols 
that we see in our President. In a post-factual world, 
symbols don't represent or misrepresent the truth. 
Symbols become truth! It's disturbing.

Once I came to know who Mark Lindquist is, and study 
his activities further, I came to expect his 
two-sentence condemnations of criminal incidents in 
the fake or real press, on KIRO FM, or on the TV news. 
This is a guy who thinks he can reach more people with 
two sentences than with something longer. This is a 
guy who would see the potential for fear from seven 
words.

I think the whole thing stinks of perception 
management, and an unhealthy obsession with 
tweet-length ideas. That's disturbing and dangerous, 
and must not be the future of law enforcement at the 
highest levels.

As a professional writer, I can comprehend how 
uniquely powerful a few words can be. As a citizen, 
I'm disturbed by how deeply Lindquist engages in 
shaping perceptions with just a few words, precisely 
because I don't think the Prosecutor should be so 
wrapped up in perceptions. The Prosecutor should be 
wrapped up in the totality of facts! Convictions, not 
arrests, should enthuse a prosecutor. It's like Pierce 
County has chosen a prosecutor who sees the job like 
an appearance on American Idol. It's a mismatch, it's 
disturbing, and it makes me believe the Pierce County 
judiciary is the only thing preventing a total 
collapse of justice.


# See Bar complaint

It took a very long time before the facts of my bar 
complaint came into focus. Lindquist has an "absolute 
right" to try me, and I have no recourse regarding the 
extreme expense he burdened onto my family. But why 
did he go on TV? And what did he say about me there? I 
would come to understand his statements were clear, 
unequivocal violations of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct, standard national rules that govern all 
lawyers, with special rules for prosecutors.

One of his "critics", an [unusually accomplished 
attorney named Bertha 
Fitzer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B99TXZsyu_78aGxibWQ5cXhBQlk/view), 
said Lindquist doesn't understand which kinds of 
activities are and are not violations of the RPC. My 
theory is that he just can't say no to TV cameras and 
exposure. If he had the discipline to only speak about 
the convicted, this would be fine, but he doesn't 
discriminate between the convicted and the merely 
accused. I think that's a clue to a lack of discipline 
and moral character. At my job in the high tech field, 
I'd love to pass off vaporware as my finished work. 
But that's now how engineering works. That's not how 
any honest bragging works. You do the job, and then 
you brag. I don't think Lindquist cares enough about 
what's true, and goes with whatever seems cool to say 
at the moment. That's consistent with a background in 
reality-inspired fiction. It's also incredibly unjust 
for people caught up in his plans. Once accused, I 
couldn't even respond to him without risking danger. 
Based on my own experience, and having studied the 
claims of his many critics, I have the sense he 
doesn't believe in fighting fair.

## More abuse

My family cautions me that Mark tries to hurt people 
who get in his way. The Busto investigation made this 
pattern incredibly clear. He chose to break the rules 
governing lawyers when he spoke about me to the press. 
He chose to try me based on the risk that his abuse 
would result in bad press or censure from the Bar 
Association. Now that I've been acquitted and have 
come forward, he may seek to abuse me more. His 
attorney, Mr. Fogg, demeans complaintants when 
justifying Mark's bad behavior in the press. Mark 
engaged in cybersquatting to undermine the campaign of 
a political opponent. Obsessed, he abused Ms. Nissen 
and Ms. Dalsing using powerful County resources. His 
public statements in response to Mr. Merrival's 
whisleblower complaint were knowingly false and 
abusive, the Busto Report concluded.

So my family is wise. It won't surprise me when he 
maligns me again, questions my motives or sanity or 
something, and of course Mr. Fogg will insist Mark's 
misbehavior is consistent with prosecutors over 
decades. In a word, that's 
[gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting). 
But if I remained silent, I would be turning my back 
on the remarkably brave people who have already stood 
up to him. What he did to me, he's done to many, 
including many who lacked the resources I have to 
fight back.

# See Public opprobrium

One of the Rules of Professional Conduct insists that 
statements to a large audience by a prosector about a 
defendant should not risk raising *public opprobrium* 
about the accused. I laugh about this term. It just 
means words that make the public hate you. Even 
truthful words may be prohibited under this Rule. The 
accused is supposed to get silence from the 
prosecutor, so an impartial jury can be found. And the 
prosecutor's case should be made to the court, not to 
the news-watching public.

I remembered throughout the many hearings and the 
trial, I thought, "Dude, if you'd just drop this, I'd 
walk away. You aren't the reason I'm here. You know 
your department got conned. You know you spoke some 
terse, false, and maligning words about me. You don't 
know (yet) that my own verbal cannons can train on 
you, too. You don't know it yet, but I, too, can raise 
public opprobrium toward your performance. You 
slandered me based on seven words. I'm taking you down 
based on seven years. Fair's fair, I guess. If that's 
how you wanna do this, OK."

Now I've found a measure of fun and comfort assuming 
the persona of [Fake Mark 
Lidquist](https://twitter.com/FakeMkLindquist/), the 
image-obsessed media hound who has hurt doe eyes for 
everyone who isn't impressed with his badgering, cruel 
treatment of defendants and subordinants alike. I 
borrow from the clear words of credible sources in 
court documents and official memoes. It's a turkey 
shoot, because at this point the patterns of 
narcissistic abuse within the Prosecutor's Office are 
so numerous and clear. And I worry that people who 
can't laugh might succumb to despair. I remember that 
right now there's a guy in jail who couldn't fight 
back against illicit prosecutor behavior as I have 
done.

# See The custody trial

I didn't prevail. The sharpest fact in my failure was 
the time of Emily's death. Had she lived another six 
months, I would be in Pierce County, doing everything 
Emily asked me to do there.

# Ongoing opprobium

Anyone who googles my name sees this. The dishonest 
police reports should not have been accepted as fact, 
but they were. Did Lindquist need to say to the press 
that investigators consider me a threat? No, and it's 
a clear violation of the rules governing him to do so. 
Now that the court rejected his claim, I don't see him 
going on TV to correct his earlier statements. He 
thinks he makes TV for a living, and the facts come 
second.

# See The future

I always had a healthy skepticism about the clarity of 
claims made to a court, and by law enforcement on 
television. Now I know for a certainty that some 
officials make deeply misleading statements, and once 
made, stand by their untrue words to the bitter end. 
Lindquist has followed this pattern through more 
controversies than my own. In government, just as in 
commerce, we are as good as our leaders. There's no 
magic that keeps terrible decisionmakers out of power. 
Terrible people often seek power. Some people think 
it's their birthright, to rule, even without 
accountability. Democracy's tools--including 
institutions like an independent court, a free press, 
standards for lawyers enforced by the Bar Association, 
and regular elections--are society's mechanisms to 
remove terrible leaders. There's absolutely no 
guarantee these tools will work, but they are the best 
we have.

# One experience, one voice

One big challenge facing people who wish to remove 
Lindquist from office is the inherant complexity of 
the work done by the Prosecutor's office. Most trials 
include a lot of details. How do voters evaluate the 
quality of the prosecutor's work without having to 
know all the details of a trial, enough to make an 
independent judgement. There are sensible approaches 
to this:

## Wins v. Losses

## Setbacks on appeal

## Bar complaints

## WWWS - What would Wikipedia say?

Here's what it does say:

[Mark Lindquist, the laywer, on 
Wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lindquist)

I've been your humble servant building out this 
explanation. Over the years since my trial, another 
party has taken a very different approach. I've 
[written about the ongoing street battle](wp.html) to 
accurately reflect Mark's law career using neutral 
sources, vs. the person or persons who dilligently and 
intelligently sabotaged any coverage of the facts.

# Conclusion

In my exposure to Pierce County justice, I've come to 
the view that bad people collude to accomplish bad 
things in Pierce County, and good people struggle to 
stop them. That's an unsavory view, but I've seen 
enough to believe it. I hope good people can work 
together again here and do what's in the interest of 
real justice for everyone: The accused, the law 
enforcement professionals, and the victims of crime 
all deserve an honest authority. The guy in charge now 
needs to go home and leave justice to those whose 
committment to it is genuine. Please, embrace the 
necessary complexity of grinding fine to reach 
justice, and leave these dirty deals, photo ops and 
sound bites behind.

But here's the problem: That guy has $100,000 and a 
fair amount of name recognition. It's dangerously 
likely he'll be re-elected.

# A challenger and a challenge

I've never met her, but [Mary 
Robnett](https://maryforprosecutor.com) is clearly an 
eminently qualified candidate for this job. Due in 
large part to a [rock guitarist 
friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Buck), his 
largest campaign contributor, Mark Lindquist has 
around $100,000 he can spend on keeping his job. He 
also has name recognition, due to all those 
non-journalism free press pieces, and all those times 
he went on TV and talked out his ass about people who 
were only accused. He knows that breaking the lawyer 
rules lets him reach voters with his face, and his 
unexamined accounts of events he alleges to be crimes, 
but hasn't had to prove. As a writer, he also knows 
how to craft a memorable phrase about a horrible 
crime. If only that made him good at the job of 
*convicting* criminals and *ignoring* non-criminals in 
Pierce County.

Mary Robnett will not waltz into this job. I've 
provided her with my own small financial support, so 
Mary can counter Mark's spin with her clarity. As a 
technical writer in the software industry, I have 
about as much as Ben Franklin had: a quick wit and a 
printing press. I will remain active in countering the 
Lindquist delusion and smear factory until this job is 
done. Mark Lindquist is a threat. Don't wait. Round 
him up. And keep at it until there's change for the 
better in Pierce County.
