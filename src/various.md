# HMMM

One of his "critics", an [unusually accomplished attorney named Bertha 
Fitzer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B99TXZsyu_78aGxibWQ5cXhBQlk/view), said Lindquist doesn't 
understand which kinds of activities are and are not violations of the RPC. My theory is that he just 
can't say no to TV cameras and exposure. If he had the discipline to only speak about the convicted, this 
would be fine, but he doesn't discriminate between the convicted and the merely accused. I think that's a 
clue to a lack of discipline and moral character. At my job in the high tech field, I'd love to pass off 
vaporware as my finished work. But that's now how engineering works. That's not how any honest bragging 
works. You do the job, and then you brag. I don't think Lindquist cares enough about what's true, and goes 
with whatever seems cool to say at the moment. That's consistent with a background in reality-inspired 
fiction. It's also incredibly unjust for people caught up in his plans. Once accused, I couldn't even 
respond to him without risking danger. Based on my own experience, and having studied the claims of his 
many critics, I have the sense he doesn't believe in fighting fair.

My family cautions me that Mark tries to hurt people who 
get in his way. The Busto investigation made this pattern 
incredibly clear. He chose to break the rules governing 
lawyers when he spoke about me to the press. He chose to 
try me based on the risk that his abuse would result in bad 
press or censure from the Bar Association. Now that I've 
been acquitted and have come forward, he may seek to abuse 
me more. His attorney, Mr. Fogg, demeans complainants in 
the press when justifying Mark's bad behavior. Mark engaged 
in cybersquatting to undermine the campaign of a political 
opponent. Obsessed, he abused Ms. Nissen, Mr. Ames, and Ms. 
Dalsing using powerful County resources. And the Busto 
Report concluded his public statements in response to Mr. 
Merrival's whisleblower complaint were knowingly false and 
abusive.

So my family is wise to warn me. It won't surprise me when 
he maligns me again, questions my motives or sanity or 
something, and of course Mr. Fogg will insist Mark's 
misbehavior is consistent with prosecutors over decades. In 
a word, that's 
[gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting). 
But if I remained silent, I would be turning my back on the 
remarkably brave people who have already stood up to him. 
What he did to me, he's done to many, including many who 
lacked the resources I have to resist.

One of the Rules of Professional Conduct insists that 
statements to a large audience by a prosector about a 
defendant should not risk raising *public opprobrium* about 
the accused. I laugh about this term. It just means words 
that make the public hate you. Even truthful words may be 
prohibited under this Rule. The accused is supposed to get 
silence from the prosecutor, so an impartial jury can be 
found. And the prosecutor's case should be made to the 
court, not to the news-watching public.

I remembered throughout the many hearings and the trial, I 
thought, "Dude, if you'd just drop this, I'd walk away. You 
aren't the reason I'm here. You know your department got 
conned. You know you spoke some terse, false, and maligning 
words about me. You don't know (yet) that my own verbal 
cannons can train on you, too. You don't know it yet, but 
I, too, can raise public opprobrium toward your 
performance. You slandered me based on seven words. I'm 
taking you down based on seven years. Fair's fair, I guess. 
If that's how you wanna do this, OK."

Now I've found a measure of fun and comfort assuming the 
persona of [Fake Mark 
Lindquist](https://twitter.com/FakeMkLindquist/), the 
image-obsessed media hound who has hurt doe eyes for 
everyone who isn't impressed with his badgering, cruel 
treatment of defendants and subordinants alike. I borrow 
from the clear words of credible sources in court documents 
and official memoes. It's a turkey shoot, because at this 
point the patterns of narcissistic abuse within the 
Prosecutor's Office are numerous and clear. And I worry 
that people who can't laugh might succumb to despair. I 
remember that right now there's a guy in jail who couldn't 
fight back against illicit prosecutor behavior as I have 
done.

# See The custody trial

I didn't prevail. The sharpest fact in my failure was the time of Emily's death. Had she lived another six 
months, I would be in Pierce County, doing everything Emily asked me to do there.

# Ongoing opprobium

Anyone who googles my name sees this. I don't let it bug me. I really did write those words, and associate 
them with that video. And I was called a father in the goofiest news report about me, ever.

The dishonest police reports should not have been accepted as fact, but I understand how and why it 
happened. Still, did Lindquist need to say to the press that investigators consider me a threat? No, and 
it's a clear violation of the that should govern him. Now that the court rejected his claim, I don't see 
him going on TV to correct his earlier statements. He thinks he makes TV for a living. The facts come 
second.

# We can. Will we?

In democracy, citizens need to make the history, through real and overwhelming effort.

I always had a healthy skepticism about the clarity of claims made to a court, and by law enforcement on 
television. Now I know for a certainty that some officials make deeply misleading statements, and once 
made, stand by their untrue words to the bitter end. Lindquist has followed this pattern through more 
controversies than my own. In government especially, our nation is only as good as its leaders. There's no 
magical sure thing that keeps terrible decisionmakers out of power. Terrible people often seek power. Some 
people think it's their birthright to rule, even without accountability or results. Democracy's 
tools--including institutions like an independent court, a free press, regular elections, and standards 
for lawyers enforced by the Bar Association--are society's mechanisms to remove terrible leaders. There's 
absolutely no guarantee these tools will work, but they are the best we have.

# One experience, one voice

One big challenge facing people who wish to remove Lindquist from office is the inherant complexity of the 
work done by the Prosecutor's office. Most trials include a lot of details. How do voters evaluate the 
quality of the prosecutor's work without having to know all the details of a trial, enough to make an 
independent judgement. There are sensible approaches to this:

## Wins v. Losses

Associated Press broke the story on Lindquist's record on appeals, which are the best test of a trial 
lawyer's performance.

## WWWS - What would Wikipedia say?

Here's what it does say:

[Mark Lindquist, the laywer, on Wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lindquist)

I built this detailed and meticulously researched coverage of Mark's law career as an elected official.

I've been your humble servant building out this explanation. Over the years since my trial, another party 
has taken a very different approach. I've [written about the ongoing street battle](wp.html) to accurately 
reflect Mark's law career using neutral sources, vs. the person or persons who dilligently and 
intelligently sabotaged any coverage of the facts.

I hope good people can work together again here and do what's in the interest of 
real justice for everyone: The accused, the law enforcement professionals, and the victims of crime all 
deserve an honest authority. The guy in charge now needs to go home and leave justice to those whose 
committment to it is genuine. Please, embrace the necessary complexity of grinding fine to reach justice, 
and leave these dirty deals, photo ops and sound bites behind.

But here's the problem: That guy has $100,000 and a fair amount of name recognition. It's dangerously 
likely he'll be re-elected.

# A challenger and a challenge

I've never met her, but [Mary Robnett](https://maryforprosecutor.com) is clearly an eminently qualified 
candidate for this job. Due in large part to a [rock guitarist 
friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Buck), his largest campaign contributor, Mark Lindquist has 
around $100,000 he can spend on keeping his job. That's a lot. He also has name recognition, due primarily 
to enormous efforts at being seen under any pretext, even for fabricating a pretext that he didn't wait, 
that he's rounding 'em up, even when his job only begins the day of an arrest. People see his spooky face 
on all those non-journalism free press pieces. He knows that breaking the lawyer rules lets him be seen by 
large audiences, spinning poetic but unexamined accounts of events he alleges to be crimes, but hasn't had 
to prove. As a commercial fiction writer, he knows how to craft a memorable phrase about the saddest and 
scariest occurances society has to experience. I'm not the first to conclude he treats facts as optional 
in performance of prosecutor duties. Nothing about his enormous investment in fake newspapers like Tacoma 
Weekly and "arrangements" on TV news (like KIRO) makes him good at *convicting* criminals. Do you see King 
county's prosecutor on TV talking about arrested people? No, Dan talks about convictions, because a 
prosecutor's job only starts when there's an arrest. Courts stil place facts first, leaving Lindquist with 
a busted record of prosecuting poorly, expensively, and inefficiently. He doesn't really keep us safe.

Mary Robnett will not waltz into this job. Change can only come when enough people offset all that effort 
in building a PR scheme of tricks on TV and newsprint. How many millions in dirty schemes and huge fines 
will Pierce County blow on this unapologetic liar before voters realize Mark Lindquist is a threat? Don't 
wait. Round him up. Dont stop until this problem is solved in Pierce County.

# Collapse

When Emily died, he moved me onto his livingroom futon, and I couldn't 
move anymore. I had worked so hard, from dawn to night, to keep Emily 
alive and our daughter emotionally well. I have 220 pages documentation 
of these days written by the hospice staff that I can't read yet. In 
the midst of it, and before, Emily's dad already began his freaky dirty 
tricks on us. As she lost walking ability, he was already crafting lies 
and  contrivedpanics to subvert us, but again, that's a story for another day. It 
made us both incredibly angry. We never missed a single chemotherapy or 
a family therapy session. Once her dad would show up with his 
wives to abuse me in family therapy. Never saw him at chemo. Rarely saw 
him in the house where she was dying..

I'm saying here that I was already emotionally broken when Mark charged 
me with 7 threats to murder. It has taken years to feel almost normal 
again.

My brother had generously housed me in his basement apartment, but as an accused felon, I had to leave due 
to agreements in his child's immediate family: no felons, convicted or otherwise! So I had to move to my 
older brother's garage attic. It's not suitable housing, but he does have a laid back mindset, sitting at 
a little table in his front yard, using a lazy susan to separate blue glass from gravel, a blend of glass 
and gravel Home Depot intentionally pre-blended. Both crises brought me much closer to my family.
