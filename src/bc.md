# Bar Complaint - draft

Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist violated various 
Rules of Professional Conduct when he appeared to speak 
about me and my arrest on KIRO Evening News, a regional 
broadcast television news program, and cited by 
the KIRO reporter in the news article that accompanied the 
news broadcast as published by KIRO on its website.

On February 22th, 2015, Prosecutor Lindquist charged me 
with four counts of Felony Harassment for posting a message 
and video to Facebook, Cause No. 15-1-00747-7.

The Prosecutor added 3 additional felonies before the 
trial, including a Class B felony.

The Class B felony couldn't withstand a pre-trial motion, 
and I was acquitted of all other charges after a bench 
trial.

Pierce County voters may or may not want a prosecutor who 
pushes meritless charges through an entire trial, but the 
very public statements Lindquist made about me merit the 
review and censure of the Bar Association.

## Public and prejudicial extrajudicial comments

On the evening of my arraignment, Prosecutor Lindquist 
appeared on KIRO Evening News, a program transmitted 
through cables and terrestrial transmitters into homes in 
Pierce County and throughout the Puget Sound area. That 
same evening, KIRO also published an article on its website 
that visually includes the broadcast news segment. The 
video features two of Lindquist’s statements about me, and 
the written journalism includes another. In the televised 
interview, Lindquist said:

** *LINDQUIST: We didn’t wait. We rounded him up.* **

The written journalism that accompanies the video of the 
broadcast published on kiro7.com says:

** *Lindquist said investigators consider Dempsey a threat, 
so his office didn't wait to jail him. “This is an ongoing 
investigation, but we wanted to move quick,” said 
Lindquist.* **

These statements to the press are prejudicial to the cause 
of justice. Two of the three claims are contradicted by 
facts stated in the charging document by his deputy.

An accurate statement by Lindquist might be “We waited over 
a month, but the accused cooperated extra-ordinarily when 
made aware of our warrant.”

I considered his public statements so dangerous that I 
waived my right to a jury trial. Any juror might have seen 
that television broadcast and formed an impression of me 
based on Lindquist's false and maligning words to the press.

## Background

Law enforcement became aware of the complaint on January 
12th. I became aware of the complaint on February 20th, 
five weeks later, when officers located my counsel outside 
a Superior Courtroom and notified him of the Probable Cause 
for Arrest. My counsellor called me around lunch time. At 
1pm, my counsellor told police that I would turn myself in 
at the County City Building before 4:30pm. I left work 
early from my office in downtown Seattle, and introduced 
myself to sheriffs inside the county City building at the 
agreed-upon time.

## Claim: Investigators consider Dempsey a threat

Regardless of why his staff thought this, Lindquist saying 
it to the press was an obvious violation of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct.

## Claim: Law Enforcement didn't wait

I can't figure out what made Lindquist say this, but the 
extrajudicial statement is a clear violation of your Rules 
of Professional Conduct. Lindquist knew how I came into 
custody, as the Charging Papers conclude:

** *The defendant’s attorney was contacted on Friday, 
February 20 by law enforcement. At their request, the 
defendant did turn himself in to the sheriff’s office later 
that afternoon.* **

Knowing the enormous time elapsed between the complaint and 
the warrant, I've wondered what Lindquist meant by his very 
public statement that he didn't wait. Perhaps he was not 
referring to the five weeks between receiving the complaint 
and contacting my attorney at the County-City Building. 
Perhaps instead he was referring to the time elapsed 
between gaining the court order for the arrest warrant, and 
knowing I’m in custody. What he meant is a question for 
Lindquist, but not a relevant question, as your Rules 
obligate him to be mindful of how the large audience might 
interpret his words. In fact, the speed at which I entered 
custody was the result of *my* disciplined effort to 
respond appropriately to the court's order, and submit 
immediately to the lawful authority of the state. *I’m the 
one who didn’t wait.* But by claiming his actions were 
purposefully swift, Lindquist implies an urgency to 
apprehend me that heightened public opprobrium, endangering 
my ability to get a fair trial.

## Claim: Law Enforcement rounded me up

What does it mean to round a man up? It means to take him 
from his freedom, his home and friends. It means to 
transfer his fate into the hands of another, his captor. It 
implies effort, such as the effort of finding him, gaining 
control of him, and taking him to the place of the captor’s 
choice. Another man might hide from being found, resist 
losing independence, and defy efforts to be relocated. All 
these images accompany law enforcement rounding a man up. 
In each nuance, saying I was rounded up impugns my 
character by implying images contrary to the fact that by 
my own volition, under my own power, and at my own expense, 
I immediately travelled 33 miles into the custody and 
confinement of the state, knowing well through counsel that 
I might not appear before a judge until after the weekend. 
Lindquist’s folksy language implies the force of the state 
was needed and employed to gain my custody, which suggests 
I hold lawful authority in disdain, and maybe even put up a 
fight. The documented facts provide no defense for this 
false and maligning innuendo.

## Worst kind of prejudicial statements

Based on the Rules of your Bar Association, Lindquist’s 
claims are the worst kind of prejudicial statements, as 
they are:

 + Statements disseminated by public communication to an 
unusually large audience, especially in the juror pool 
area,
 + Focused on the reputation of a suspect facing potential 
incarceration,
 + With a substantial likelihood of heightening public 
condemnation and materially prejudicing a trial, and
 + Knowingly false, and therefore having no law enforcement 
purpose.

(One of the three claims, that investigators thought I was 
a threat, is true. They were bamboozled. The statement by 
Lindquist, while truthful, is still a clear violation of 
the Rules of Professional Conduct.)

Your Rules insist lawyers avoid statements likely to raise 
public opprobrium toward the accused, especially those 
statements made to a large television and internet 
audience.

## Conclusion -- DRAFT

Throughout his career as an elected official, Mark 
Lindquist and his staff have violated RPC 3.6 and RPC 3.8.

His false statements about me to the press threatened my 
ability to get a fair trial.

In filing this complaint, if history is a guide, I 
anticipate hearing still more abusive, false claims about 
me in the press from Lindquist's attorney, who has derided 
and maligned previous complaintants obviously victimized by 
similar extrajudicial statements that violate RPC 3.6 and 
3.8.

That Lindquist's attorney brags in the press of "zero 
chance" that the public hearing he faces represents "zero 
chance" of suspension is a flagrant disregard for the 
seriousness of his behavior and sovereignty of your 
Assocation to discipline clear and chronic violators.

Complaints to your body have not deterred his continued 
violations of these Rules.

That he seeks and derives visibility before his electorate 
based on falsehoods and charging documents rather than 
verdicts should be of grave concern to all advocates of 
justice.

Justice in Pierce County faces clear, documented, repeated, 
and serious danger as long as Mr. Lindquist is permitted to 
practice law.
