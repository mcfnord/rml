<title>Bar Complaint - Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist</title>

April 20, 2018

Washington State Bar Association  
1325 4th Ave, Suite 600  
Seattle, WA 98101

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist violated various Rules 
of Professional Conduct in verbal statements broadcast on _KIRO 
Evening News_ and in a statement cited in the news article that 
accompanied the news broadcast published by KIRO on its website.
([Exhibit 3](http://www.kiro7.com/news/police-father-made-death-threat-against-judge-thro/43394653))

On February 22th, 2015, Prosecutor Lindquist charged me 
with four counts of Felony Harassment for posting a message 
and video to Facebook, Cause No. 15-1-00747-7. (Exhibit 2)
The prosecutor added 3 additional felonies before the 
trial, including a Class B felony.
**The Class B felony couldn't withstand a pre-trial motion, 
and I was acquitted of all other charges after a bench 
trial.** (Exhibit 4)

The very public statements Lindquist made about me merit the 
review and censure of the Bar Association.

## Public and prejudicial extrajudicial comments

On the evening of my arraignment, Prosecutor Lindquist 
appeared on _KIRO Evening News_, a program transmitted 
through cables and terrestrial transmitters into homes in 
Pierce County and throughout the Puget Sound area. That 
same evening, KIRO published an article on its website 
that visually includes the broadcast news segment. The 
video features two of Lindquist’s statements about me, and 
the written journalism includes a third. In the televised 
statement, Lindquist said:

** *LINDQUIST: We didn’t wait. We rounded him up.* **

The written journalism that accompanies the video of the 
broadcast published on kiro7.com says:

** *Lindquist said investigators consider Dempsey a threat, 
so his office didn't wait to jail him. "This is an ongoing 
investigation, but we wanted to move quick," said 
Lindquist.* **

All three statements to the press are prejudicial to the cause 
of justice, and two of the three are contradicted by facts 
stated in the charging document.
An accurate statement by Lindquist might be: *“We waited over 
a month, but the accused cooperated extra-ordinarily when 
made aware of our warrant.”*
I considered his public statements so dangerous that I 
waived my right to a jury trial. Any juror might have seen 
that television broadcast and formed an impression of me 
based on Lindquist's false and maligning words to the press.

## Relevant facts

Law enforcement became aware of the complaint on January 
12th. (Exhibit 1) I became aware of the complaint on February 20th, 
five weeks later, when officers located my counsel outside 
a Superior Courtroom and notified him of the Probable Cause 
for Arrest. (Exhibit 1) My attorney called me around lunch time. At 
1pm, my attorney told police that I would turn myself in 
at the County-City Building before 4:30pm. I left work 
early from my office in downtown Seattle, and introduced 
myself to sheriffs inside the County-City Building at the 
agreed-upon time. (Exhibit 2)

## Claim: Law Enforcement didn't wait

This extrajudicial statement is a clear violation of 
your Rules of Professional Conduct, and is false.

Lindquist knew how I came into custody, as the 
Charging Papers conclude:

** *The defendant’s attorney was contacted on Friday, 
February 20 by law enforcement. At their request, the 
defendant did turn himself in to the sheriff’s office 
later that afternoon.* ** (Exhibit 2)

Knowing the enormous time elapsed between the 
complaint and the warrant, I've wondered what 
Lindquist meant by his very public statement that he 
didn't wait. Perhaps he was not referring to the five 
weeks between receiving the complaint and contacting 
my attorney at the County-City Building. Perhaps 
instead he was referring to the time elapsed between 
gaining the court order for the arrest warrant, and 
asking my attorney to contact me. What he meant is a 
question for Lindquist, but not a relevant question, 
as your Rules obligate him to be mindful of how the 
large audience would interpret his words. In fact, the 
speed at which I entered custody was the result of 
*my* principled effort to respond appropriately to the 
court's order, and submit immediately to the lawful 
authority of the state. *I’m the one who didn’t wait.* 
But by claiming his actions were purposefully swift, 
Lindquist implies an urgency to apprehend me that 
heightened public opprobrium, and endangered my 
ability to get a fair trial.

## Claim: Law Enforcement rounded me up

This extrajudicial statement is a clear violation of your Rules 
of Professional Conduct, and is false.

What does it mean to round a man up? It means to 
<a href=https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-correct-way-to-turn-yourself-in-for-a-warrant/answer/David-Davidson-94 style=text-decoration:none>take him</a>
from his freedom, his home and friends. It means to 
transfer his fate into the hands of another, his captor. It 
implies effort, such as the effort of finding him, gaining 
control of him, and taking him to the place of the captor’s 
choice. Another man might hide from being found, resist 
losing independence, and defy efforts to be relocated. All 
these images accompany law enforcement rounding a man up. 

In each nuance, saying I was rounded up impugns my 
character with imagery contrary to the fact that by 
my own volition, under my own power, and at my own expense, 
I immediately travelled 33 miles into the custody and 
confinement of the state, knowing well through counsel that 
I was unlikely to appear before a judge until after the weekend.
I deferred to the preferences of the 
arresting authority, but Lindquist’s folksy language 
implies the force of the state was needed and 
employed to gain my custody, which suggests I hold 
lawful authority in disdain, and maybe even put up 
a fight. _Guidelines for Applying Rule 3.6_ allow 
him to <a href=guidelines36.html 
style=text-decoration:none>specify the time and 
place of arrest</a>, which would paint a picture 
quite contrary to the one he manufactured. The 
documented facts provide no defense for 
Lindquist's false and maligning innuendo.

## Claim: Investigators consider me a threat

His investigators were bamboozled by [dishonest 
complainants](dishonest.html), but regardless of why his staff 
thought this, Lindquist saying it to the press was an obvious 
violation of Rule 3.6, especially as clarified in the 
[Guideline](guidelines36.html) for its application. I was not at 
large, or on the run. I was safely in the custody of the state. 
So why make people fear me? His very public statement, like the 
rest, substantially endangered my right to a fair trial.

## Worst kind of prejudicial statements

Based on the Rules of your Bar Association, 
Lindquist’s claims are the worst kind of prejudicial extrajudicial
statements, as they are:

 + Statements disseminated by public communication to an 
unusually large audience, especially in the juror pool area,
 + Focused on the reputation of a suspect facing potential 
incarceration,
 + Likely to heighten public 
condemnation and materially prejudice a trial, and
 + False or prohibited, and therefore having no law enforcement purpose.

## Censure is needed

Throughout his career as an elected official, 
<a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lindquist style=text-decoration:none>Mark Lindquist</a>
has
violated RPC 3.6 and RPC 3.8. His misleading statements about me 
to the press forced me to waive my jury trial, and threatened my 
ability to get a fair one. That he uses the accused to gain 
visibility before his electorate based on maligning falsehoods 
and charging documents rather than verdicts should be of grave 
concern to all advocates of justice. Lindquist's dismissive 
responses to complaints to your Association are of particular 
concern. Justice in Pierce County faces clear, serious, 
documented, repeated danger as long as Mr. Lindquist is 
permitted to practice law.

Yours faithfully,

John Dempsey
