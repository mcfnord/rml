<title>Dishonest - Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist</title>
# Emily died

My story began in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico over ten years ago. It 
included a long prologue of complicated relationships. Maybe it began 
the day I took this picture:

In 2013, it became clear my friend would die. In December, I came to 
Tacoma to care for her as she did, and to give our daughter everything 
we could through the crisis and beyond. 
In June, 2014, [she died](http://ladybug.today). The child's biological
father is a bum in Florida, and her grandfather had his own ideas
about what should happen next.

# 3am, Jan 1, 2015

I'm skipping the agony of her slow death, the 18-hour days of caring 
for her at home in hospice, and 6 months of bizarre accusations in 
family court. Documents claim I drugged her, separated her from her 
family, stole her money, didn't love her, made child porn, and took 
showers with our daughter. I'm sure i missed some accusations. Why not 
throw out every creative, scary idea and see if anything sticks? There 
were also brazen, failed efforts to take control of the child's trust 
money. It was good training in the lifecycle of *specious* claims.

It meant the world to step out to a New Year's party with good friends. 
I asked everyone about the toughest year of their life, cuz I had just 
finished mine. I got wild singing about the hard year behind me, and 
good one ahead.

I barely remember the deed Lindquist called a crime. I have no dispute 
it was a very bad idea, but it was never a crime. I was very tired and 
buzzing from caffiene after a heck of a party. I chose the wrong words. 
In a career of trying to choose the right ones, I picked the wrong 
ones, not based on my meaning, but because of another interpretation, 
probably obvious in any other state of mind. It was incredibly late and 
I was incredibly worn out when I wrote seven words and fell asleep. The 
prosecutor wanted me to spend more than a year in prison for those 
seven words.

## Scary police reports

It takes work to translate a Facebook post into an arrest warrant. 
Three people worked hard to get to that point. Two were dishonest, and 
one was in over her head.

## Dishonest family lawyer

The first contact to law enforcement was made by an attorney. Great 
start! Attorneys are truthful, right?

On the witness stand, my attorney asked her to measure the level of 
fear she felt toward me, and she swore it was 4 out of 5. Pretty scary. 
So we pressed play on this recording.

*embed*

She sure looked freaked out as it played. She confirmed her 4-of-5 fear 
metric, and repeated a dorky line, "We don't know what he's capable 
of!" We do know she's capable of going from bored to terrified sometime 
*after* calling the police on the non-emergency contact line. And we 
know the Prosecutor knew or should have known there was clear evidence 
that strongly contradicted her claim of mortal fear.

## Dishonest dad

Key to the scary news report is the fantastically false police report 
quoting Emily's dad, a retired fireman. He's particularly skillful at 
sounding scary. Here's the report:

*embed*

Why he hates me relates to some abnormal psychology that I might 
explain later. He's so dishonest that it's boring. What matters here 
is: The prosecutor claimed he read the surreal panorama of accusations 
and insinuations filed in the custody dispute. He must have concluded 
the claims highlighted by KIRO were false. Yet he still wanted a trial.

## Excited G.A.L. in too deep

The bar is pretty low for family law attorneys. In my criminal case in 
addition to Ms. Young's obvious dishonesty, the woman representing the 
child got in way too deep, and obviously violated the Rules of 
Professional Conduct. She cooperated with the police, which was her 
right, but then kept her involvement a secret from the custody judge. 
Her feeble, ignorant defense of her actions shows that she doesn't 
understand the basics of this transgression:

She must have read 200 pages of hostile accusations against me. Nowhere 
in any was there any accusation of violence. But I think she got 
whipped up by the excitement of a police investigation. It made her 
feel significant. The judge fired her. She still appears unaware why.

## The rest

The charges specified 3 others who the prosecutor claimed were victims. 
Two said basically they didn't see the message as a serious threat, and 
the judge called one person "brittle".

To be accused of threatening to murder a judge I had only great 
feelings toward was particularly insulting and surreal. I found the 
judge involved to be brilliant and adorable, fully deserving of his 
esteemed position as the county's lead justice.

I never intended to communicate a threat to murder, and intent is a 
critical part of felony law. Some of the people who claimed to be 
victims worked very hard to project criminal intent upon me. Upon 
realizing this, the prosecutor should have noticed and quit the whole 
thing. ([Mark knows how intent works in felony law.](http://komonews.com/news/local/prosecutors-want-harsh-punishment-for-teen-suspects-in-accidental-gunfire-at-tacoma-school))
Instead, Mark Lindquist dug up 7 
people as victims, and in 7 distinct instances, the judge said nope. 
That's not one error, but 7 errors in judgement. That record is a 
crappy use of County resources. Why did Mark make these choices?
Let me explain to you why Lindquist's choices with the media 
prevented him from doing the right thing. 

# The recall campaign

Imagine my surprise when I'm out on bail and learn that citizens 
have accused Lindquist of serious offenses in office, most notably an 
unhealthy pattern of going on TV to talk about people accused of 
crimes. In my own county (King), the prosecutor might be visible after 
a conviction--after all his work culminates in a persuaded jury. In 
legal terms, the difference between public statements about the accused 
vs. the convicted is a huge one.

In a way, America gives many elected officials 4 years to screw up. We 
rarely remove officials during their term. Rather, we just find someone 
better at the next election. Recalls are notoriously complicated to 
achieve, and I admire how hard so many worked at this high goal. We all 
should recognize that the recall cleared the first and most serious 
hurdle: A judge agreed there was enough evidence to believe Mark 
Lindquist has committed offenses serious enough to merit a recall 
effort. According to that judge, it is very likely this official 
committed acts that merit removal from office. Since then, the evidence 
has grown stronger and louder.

# SCOTUS and me

While I was on bail, the Supreme 
Court 
ruled in my 
favor, in a case incredibly similar to my own. While the nation 
celebrated the marriage equality ruling, the SCOTUS ruling on *Alonis 
v. USA* was as significant to speech advocates. In a case much more 
heinous than my seven words, the Supremes ruled there was no real 
threat because there was no intention to threaten. I thought at 
the time that surely the prosecutor would drop the charges in light
of the Supremes' affirmation that felonies require *mens rea*, or *the 
guilty mind*. And 
had he not gone on TV and 
said those things, I bet he would have dropped it.

# Loyalty first

From beginning to end, my case was handled by a deputy named Patrick 
Cooper. Since losing the case against me, he has been promoted. This is 
consistent with my belief that I was tried to reduce risk Lindquist 
incurred with his false and prohibited statements to the press. 
Loyalty, not success, was Cooper's valued contribution.

# My testimony

[You can read my testimony and words from my accusers](http://tucc.us/dtm_cop_lies.html).

# Trials seek the whole truth

At first blush, when Mark went 
on television, he seemed to have the ingredients a headline-craving 
prosecutor must love: A dangerous suspect, an allegation of a crime 
against a judge, and an outrageous music video.

[The petition contends Lindquist pays extra attention to criminal cases that receive media attention, and 
seeks harsher penalties for defendants in such 
cases.](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article26347357.html)

What he had was a deliciously *specious* case.

**specious**: *misleading in appearance, especially misleadingly attractive.*

(If you want to understand narcissists, write this word at the top of 
your notes. It's on the quiz!)

# Speciousness is a narcissist go-to ploy

Narcissist. It's a word that gets thrown around a lot, when we talk 
about the President, and the Prosecutor. It's something more than just 
a self-centered person. It's someone who is disturbingly self-centered. 
A narcissist is so self-centered that they will do *anything* to make 
you focus on them, and their explanation of events. Specious claims are 
popular with narcissists because they give them sheen and shimmer. Who 
cares what's true? What matters to them is what might seem true right 
now that makes them look maximally good.

When you try to understand how Lindquist dug so deep hiding his 
misbehavior from Nissen, just think how well he hid the truth, and for 
how long. The ability to win now and look like a hero now is like a 
drug to narcissists. They'll tell enormous lies to do it. Many lies 
hide the truth well... for a while. A narcissist is in such a 
psychological panic about building up their image now that they'll grab 
at whatever lie helps. They'll save later for later.

They're often very persuasive with you about believing it. A narcissist 
will attack the messenger.

# Perception v. Reality

When Pierce County paid for a report on Lindquist's poor leadership 
skills, Mark hired James Lynch works for Pierce County Prosecuting 
Attorney's Office full-time for almost two years. Do you know how Mr. 
Lynch describes his work? (I've added **bold** to the key service he 
says he provides:

_Communications expert with extensive experience and a proven ability 
to **shape perceptions** and manage media relationships. Direct public 
outreach, handle crisis communications and develop press releases. 
Leverage interpersonal skills to build strong stakeholder relationships 
and lead high-performance teams. Research and write creative stories. 
Produce and promote special projects across diverse media. Use digital 
tools, Internet resources and social media to skillfully deliver clear, 
concise, informative messaging._

# In Conclusion

Mark's improper statements to the press locked him in to prosecuting 
me. He was already taking criticism for abusing media access when my 
trial began. So he made a Hail Mary play to try to convict me. Even 
fully knowing the Prosecutor's Office had been tricked into the arrest, 
he stacked up charges in a ploy to intimidate me into settling for a 
misdermeanor. Everyone takes the plea. And if I took a plea, I would 
have much less credibility with the Bar Association and everyone else.

The trial judge rejected all 7 of Mark's claim of felony conduct, and 
didn't even convict on any lesser crimes. 

Pierce County pays an 
attorney named Mr. Fogg to tell whoppers to the press about Mark's odds 
in his upcoming Disciplinary Hearing before the Bar, and I'm sure 
they're both crafting insults to lob at me, too, for what I did and why 
it was critical they consume court time and County resources to try me. 
The judge strongly disagreed, and you should to. Furthermore, when 
a prosecutor is reckless, and thoughtless, and focused on *shaping 
perceptions* rather than trafficking in the truth, it paints a very 
dark picture for the cause of justice. 

Dishonest men with tall tales 
stumble into police stations every day. Such events should not become 
the gristle of corrupt, media-hungry state attorneys like Mark 
Lindquist, with the full force of the state behind them. The Rules of 
Professional Conduct establish clear ways to avoid that, but Mark 
thumbs his nose at those rules, and jeopardizes the cause of justice to 
prop up the cause of Mark Lindquist. 

Only Pierce County voters can stop 
this clear pattern of reckless which is, I am sure, an ongoing 
nightmare for many men and women falsely accused and incarcerated right 
now. We know some of the names of people he has victimized by his 
malfescence: 
Dalsing, [Justice](https://twitter.com/FakeMkLindquist/status/960200235011031040?s=19), Dempsey, Nissen, Ames. We also know names of dangeous 
men who [walk free](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/many-pierce-county-cases-reversed-because-of-prosecutors/) because Lindquist broke other rules all prosecutors 
are expected to follow. So much for keeping us safe. The evidence is now abundantly clear and the 
remedy--a change at the top of Pierce County's law enforcement--is due.
