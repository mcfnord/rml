# Emily died

My story began in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico over ten years ago. It 
included a long prologue of complicated relationships. Maybe it began 
the day I took this picture:

In 2013, it became clear my friend would die. In December, I came to 
Tacoma to care for her as she did, and to give our daughter everything 
we could through the crisis and beyond. 
In June, 2014, [she died](http://ladybug.today). The child's biological
father is a bum in Florida, and her grandfather had his own ideas
about what should happen next.

# 3am, Jan 1, 2015

I'm skipping the agony of her slow death, the 18-hour days of caring 
for her at home in hospice, and 6 months of bizarre accusations in 
family court. Documents claim I drugged her, separated her from her 
family, stole her money, didn't love her, made child porn, and many 
other bizarre claims that seemed like someone's best angle at the time. 
There were brazen, failed efforts to take control of the child's trust 
money, too. It was good training in the lifecycle of *specious* claims.

It meant the world to step out to a New Year's party with good friends. 
I asked everyone about the toughest year of their life, cuz I had just 
finished mine. I got wild singing about the hard year behind me, and 
good one ahead.

I barely remember the deed Lindquist called a crime. I have no dispute 
it was a very bad idea, but it was never a crime. I was very tired and 
buzzing from caffiene after a heck of a party. I chose the wrong words. 
In a career of trying to choose the right ones, I picked the wrong 
ones, not based on my meaning, but because of another interpretation, 
probably obvious in any other state of mind. It was incredibly late and 
I was incredibly worn out when I wrote seven words and fell asleep. The 
prosecutor wanted me to spend more than a year in prison for those seven 
words.

# Scary police reports

It takes work to translate a Facebook post into an arrest warrant. Three people worked hard to get to that 
point. Two were dishonest, and one was in over her head.

# Dishonest family lawyer

The first contact to law enforcement was made by an attorney. Great start! Attorneys are truthful, right?

On the witness stand, my attorney asked her to measure the level of fear she felt toward me, and she swore 
it was 4 out of 5. Pretty scary. So we pressed play on this recording.

*embed*

She sure looked freaked out as it played. She confirmed her 4-of-5 fear metric, and repeated a dorky line, 
"We don't know what he's capable of!" We do know she's capable of going from bored to terrified sometime 
*after* calling the police on the non-emergency contact line.
And we know the Prosecutor knew or should have known there was clear evidence that strongly 
contradicted her claim of 
mortal fear.

# Dishonest dad

Key to the sexy news report is the fantastically false police report quoting Emily's dad, a retired 
fireman. He's particularly skillful at sounding scary, and his credentials as a recent retiree of the fire department 
probably enhanced his believability with the interviewing officer. Here's the report:

Why he hates me relates to some abnormal psychology that I might 
explain later. He's so dishonest that it's boring. What matters here 
is: The prosecutor claimed he read the surreal panorama of accusations 
and insinuations filed in the custody dispute. He must have concluded 
the claims highlighted by KIRO were false. Yet he still wanted a 
trial.

## Excited G.A.L. in too deep

The bar is pretty low for family law attorneys. In my criminal case in addition to Ms. Young's obvious 
dishonesty, the woman representing the child got in way too deep, and obviously violated the Rules of 
Professional Conduct. She cooperated with the police, which was her right, but then kept her involvement a 
secret from the custody judge. Her feeble, ignorant defense of her actions shows that she doesn't 
understand the basics of this transgression:

She must have read 200 pages of hostile accusations against me. Nowhere 
in any was there any accusation of violence. But I think she got 
whipped up by the excitement of a police investigation. It made her 
feel significant. The judge fired her. She still appears unaware why.

## The rest

The charges specified 3 others who the prosecutor claimed were victims. 
Two said basically they didn't see the message as a serious threat, and 
the judge called one person "brittle".

To be accused of threatening to murder a judge I had only great 
feelings toward was particularly insulting and surreal. I found the 
judge involved to be brilliant and adorable, fully deserving of his 
esteemed position as the county's lead justice.

I never intended to communicate a threat to murder, and intent is a 
critical part of felony law. Some of the people who claimed to be 
victims worked very hard to project criminal intent upon me. After 
examination the prosecutor should have noticed and quit the whole 
thing. But let me explain to you why Lindquist's choices with the media 
prevented him from doing that right thing. Mark Lindquist dug up 7 
people as victims, and in 7 distinct instances, the judge said nope. 
That's not one error, but 7 errors in judgement. That record is a 
crappy use of County resources. Why did Mark make these choices?

People in civil court often love the idea of involving the police. Any 
sound prosecutor would see bright yellow flags when a party in a civil 
case insists they're victims of a crime perpetrated by their opponent. 
But this prosecutor went on TV, and I believe that prevented him from 
ever having a come-to-Jesus moment about the quality of his case. So a 
judge did it for them. In the mean time, so much court time and tax 
money was wasted.

# SCOTUS and me

Being out on bail is surreal. Being on bail for a speech crime was 
another level. Anything I said anywhere could be used against me.

I remember how surreal it became when the Supreme Court ruled in my 
favor, in a case incredibly similar to my own. While the nation 
celebrated the marriage equality ruling, the SCOTUS ruling on *Alonis 
v. USA* was as significant to speech advocates. In a case much more 
heinous and much more clear, the Supremes ruled there was no real 
threat because there was no intention to threaten. Surely this meant 
the prosecutor would drop the charges. And had he not gone on TV and 
said those things, I bet he would have.

# The recall campaign

Try to imagine my surprise when I'm out on bail and learn that citizens have accused Lindquist of serious 
offenses in office, most notably an unhealthy pattern of going on TV to talk about people accused of 
crimes. In my own county (King), the prosecutor might be visible after a conviction--after all his work 
culminates in a persuaded jury. In legal terms, the difference between public statements about the accused 
vs. the convicted is a huge one.

My family quickly joined the movement to remove Lindquist. My mom may have gathered a hundred signatures 
to round him up and send him packing.

In a way, America gives many elected officials 4 years to screw up. We rarely remove officials during 
their term. Rather, we just find someone better at the next election. Recalls are notoriously complicated 
to achieve, and I admire how hard so many worked at this high goal. We all should recognize that the 
recall cleared the first and most serious hurdle: A judge agreed there was enough evidence to believe Mark 
Lindquist has committed offenses serious enough to merit a recall effort. According to that judge, it is 
very likely this official committed acts that merit removal from office. Since then, the evidence has 
grown stronger and louder.

# Loyalty first

From beginning to end, my case was handled by a deputy named Patrick Cooper. Since losing the case against 
me, he has been promoted. This is consistent with my belief that I was tried to reduce risk Lindquist 
incurred with his false and prohibited statements to the press. Loyalty, not success, was Cooper's valued 
contribution.

# My testimony

[You can read my testimony and words from my accusers](http://tucc.us/dtm_cop_lies.html).

# Trials seek the whole truth

Lindquist took a terrible case to trial. At first blush, when he went on television, he seemed to have the 
ingredients a headline-craving prosecutor must love: A dangerous suspect, an allegation of a crime against 
a judge, and an outrageous music video.

[The petition contends Lindquist pays extra attention to criminal cases that receive media attention, and 
seeks harsher penalties for defendants in such 
cases.](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article26347357.html)

What he had was a deliciously *specious* case.

**specious**: *misleading in appearance, especially misleadingly attractive.*

(If you want to understand narcissists, write this word at the top of your notes. It's on the quiz!)

# Speciousness is a narcissist go-to ploy

Narcissist. It's a word that gets thrown around a lot, when we talk about 
the President, and the Prosecutor. It's something more than just a self-centered person. It's someone who 
is disturbingly self-centered. A narcissist is so self-centered that they will do *anything* to make you 
focus on them, and their explanation of events. Specious claims are popular with narcissists because they 
give them sheen and shimmer. Who cares what's true? What matters to them is what might seem true right now 
that makes them look maximally good.

When you try to understand how Lindquist dug so deep hiding his misbehavior from Nissen, just think how 
well he hid the truth, and for how long. The ability to win now and look like a hero now is like a drug to 
narcissists. They'll tell enormous lies to do it. Many lies hide the truth well... for a while. A 
narcissist is in such a psychological panic about building up their image now that they'll grab at 
whatever lie helps. They'll save later for later.

They're often very persuasive with you about believing it. A narcissist will attack the messenger.

# Perception v. Reality

For example, James Lynch works for Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney's Office full-time for almost two
years. Do you know how Mr. Lynch describes his work? (I've added **bold** cuz WTF:)
