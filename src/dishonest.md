<title>Dishonest - Pierce County Prosecutor Mark 
Lindquist</title>
# Emily died

My story began in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico over ten 
years ago. It included a long prologue of complicated 
relationships. Maybe it began the day I took this 
picture:

In 2013, it became clear my friend would die. She was 
so much more tired. I had to be by her side for steps. 
I never minded. Everything got complicated but I never 
minded. In December, I came to Tacoma to be a full time 
father and partner through the crisis and beyond. After 
cruel suffering in hospice at home, in June, 2014, [she 
died](http://ladybug.today). The child's biological 
father is a bum in Florida, and her grandfather had his 
own ideas about what should happen next.

# 3am, Jan 1, 2015

It's proper for now to skip all the details of the 
agony of her slow death, the 18-hour days of caring for 
her at home in hospice, and 6 months of bizarre 
accusations in family court. Documents claim I drugged 
her, separated her from her family, stole her money, 
didn't love her, made child porn, and took showers with 
our daughter. I'm sure i missed some accusations. Why 
not throw out every creative, scary idea and see if 
anything sticks? There were also brazen, failed efforts 
to take control of the child's trust money. And then
Mark Lindquist came into my life.

It meant the world to step out to a New Year's party 
with good friends. I asked everyone about the toughest 
year of their life, cuz I had just finished mine. I got 
wild singing about the hard year behind me, and good 
one ahead.

I barely remember the deed Lindquist called a crime. I 
have no dispute it was a very bad idea, but it was 
never a crime. I was very tired and buzzing from 
caffiene after a heck of a party. I chose the wrong 
words. In a career of trying to choose the right ones, 
I picked the wrong ones, not based on my meaning, but 
because of another interpretation, probably obvious in 
any other state of mind. It was incredibly late and I 
was incredibly worn out when I wrote seven words and 
fell asleep. The prosecutor wanted me to spend more 
than a year in prison for those seven words.

# Scary police reports

It takes work to translate a Facebook post into an 
arrest warrant. Three people worked hard to get to that 
point. Two were dishonest, and one was in over her 
head.

## Dishonest family lawyer

The first contact to law enforcement was made by an 
attorney. Great start! Attorneys are truthful, right?

On the witness stand, my attorney asked her to measure 
the level of fear she felt toward me, and she swore it 
was 4 out of 5. Pretty scary. So we pressed play on the 
recording of her call to the police. She sure looked 
freaked out as it played, perhaps because in the 
recording, she sounded bored and annoyed (she always 
sounds annoyed). After it played, she confirmed her 
4-of-5 fear metric, and repeated a dorky line, "We 
don't know what he's capable of!" We do know she's 
capable of going from bored to terrified sometime 
*after* calling the police on the non-emergency contact 
line. And we know the Prosecutor must have reviewed 
this evidence that strongly contradicted her claim of 
mortal fear.

## Dishonest dad

Key to the scary news report is the fantastically false 
police report quoting Emily's dad, a retired fireman. 
He's particularly skillful at sounding scary. Here's 
the report:

*embed*

Why he hates me relates to some abnormal psychology 
that I might explain later. He's so dishonest that it's 
boring. What matters here is: The prosecutor claimed he 
read the surreal panorama of accusations and 
insinuations filed in the custody dispute. He must have 
concluded the claims highlighted by KIRO were false. 
Yet he still insisted on a trial.

## Excited G.A.L. in too deep

The bar is pretty low for family law attorneys. In my 
criminal case in addition to one attorney's obvious 
dishonesty, the woman representing the child got in way 
too deep, and obviously violated the Rules of 
Professional Conduct. She cooperated with the police, 
which was her right, but then kept her involvement a 
secret from the custody judge. This got her fired. And 
in her defense of her actions, she doesn't seem to 
understand why.

She must have read 200 pages of hostile accusations 
against me. Nowhere in any was there any accusation of 
violence. But I think she got whipped up by the 
excitement of a police investigation. It made her feel 
significant.

## The rest

The charges specified 4 others who the prosecutor 
claimed were victims. Two said basically they didn't 
see the message as a serious threat, and the judge 
called one person "brittle".

To be accused of threatening to murder a judge I had 
only great feelings toward was particularly insulting 
and surreal. I found him to be brilliant, fully 
deserving of his esteemed position as the county's lead 
justice.

I never intended to communicate a threat to murder, and 
intent is a critical part of felony law. Some of the 
people who claimed to be victims worked very hard to 
project criminal intent upon me. Upon realizing this, 
the prosecutor should have noticed and quit the whole 
thing. ([Mark knows how intent works in felony 
law.](http://komonews.com/news/local/prosecutors-want-harsh-punishment-for-teen-suspects-in-accidental-gunfire-at-tacoma-school))
Instead, Mark Lindquist dug up 7 people as victims, and 
in 7 distinct instances, the judge said nope. That's 
not one error, but 7 errors in judgement. That record 
is a crappy use of County resources. Why did Mark make 
these choices? Let me explain why Lindquist's 
choices with the media prevented him from doing the 
right thing.

# The recall campaign

Imagine my surprise when I'm out [on bail](televised.html) and learn that 
citizens have accused Lindquist of serious offenses in 
office, most notably an unhealthy pattern of going on 
TV to talk about people accused of crimes. 

*[The petition contends Lindquist pays extra attention 
to criminal cases that receive media attention, and 
seeks harsher penalties for defendants in such 
cases.](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article26347357.html)*

In my own county (King), the prosecutor might be 
visible after a conviction--after all his work 
culminates in a persuaded jury. In legal terms, the 
difference between public statements about the accused 
vs. the convicted is a huge one. An arrest might be the 
culmination of police work, but it's literally step One 
for a prosecutor. That's when his work *begins*. 
*Convictions* are the proper measure of a good 
prosecutor. And by that metric,
Lindquist's record is terrible.

In a way, America gives many elected officials 4 years 
to screw up. The recall cleared the first and most 
serious hurdle: A judge agreed there was enough 
evidence to believe Mark Lindquist has committed 
offenses that merit removal from office. Since then, 
the evidence has grown much stronger.

# SCOTUS and me

While I was on bail, the Supreme Court ruled in my 
favor, in a case incredibly similar to my own. While 
the nation celebrated the marriage equality ruling, the 
SCOTUS ruling on *Alonis v. USA* was as significant to 
speech advocates. In a case much more heinous than my 
seven words, the Supremes ruled there was no real 
threat because there was no intention to threaten. I 
thought at the time that surely the prosecutor would 
drop the charges in light of the Supremes' affirmation 
that felonies require *mens rea*, or *the guilty mind*. 
And had he not gone on TV and said those things, I bet 
he would have dropped it.

# Loyalty first

From beginning to end, my case was handled by a deputy 
named Patrick Cooper. Since losing the case against me, 
he has been promoted. This is consistent with my belief 
that I was tried to reduce risk Lindquist incurred with 
his false and prohibited statements to the press. 
Loyalty, not success, was Cooper's valued contribution.

# Perception v. Reality

At first blush, when Mark went on television, he seemed 
to have the ingredients a headline-craving prosecutor 
must love: A dangerous suspect, an allegation of a 
crime against a judge, and an outrageous music video.

What he had was a deliciously *specious* case.

**specious**: *misleading in appearance, especially 
misleadingly attractive.*


When Pierce County paid for a report on Lindquist's 
poor leadership skills, Mark hired James Lynch works 
for Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney's Office 
full-time for almost two years. Do you know how Mr. 
Lynch describes his work? (I've added **bold** to the 
key service he says he provides:

_Communications expert with extensive experience and a 
proven ability to **shape perceptions** and manage 
media relationships. Direct public outreach, handle 
crisis communications and develop press releases. 
Leverage interpersonal skills to build strong 
stakeholder relationships and lead high-performance 
teams. Research and write creative stories. Produce and 
promote special projects across diverse media. Use 
digital tools, Internet resources and social media to 
skillfully deliver clear, concise, informative 
messaging._

# In Conclusion

Mark's improper statements to the press locked him in 
to prosecuting me. He was already taking criticism for 
abusing media access when my trial began. So he made a 
Hail Mary play to try to convict me. After realizing
the Prosecutor's Office had been tricked into the 
arrest, he stacked up charges in a ploy to intimidate 
me into settling for a misdermeanor. Everyone takes the 
plea. I didn't.

The trial judge rejected all 7 of Mark's claim of 
felony conduct, and didn't even convict on any lesser 
crimes.

Dishonest men with tall tales stumble into police 
stations every day. Such events easily become the 
gristle of corrupt, media-hungry state attorneys like 
Mark Lindquist, with the full force of the state behind 
them. The Rules of Professional Conduct establish clear 
ways to avoid that, but Mark thumbs his nose at those 
rules, and jeopardizes the cause of justice to prop up 
the cause of Mark Lindquist.

Only Pierce County voters can stop this clear pattern 
of reckless.
We know some of the names of people he has 
victimized by his malfescence: Dalsing, 
[Justice](https://twitter.com/FakeMkLindquist/status/960200235011031040?s=19), 
Dempsey, Nissen, Ames. We also know names of dangeous 
men who [walk 
free](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/many-pierce-county-cases-reversed-because-of-prosecutors/) 
because Lindquist broke other rules all prosecutors are 
expected to follow. So much for keeping us safe. The 
evidence is now abundantly clear, and the remedy is 
due: Pierce County law enforcement needs a new leader at the top.
