# Prologue

My story began in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico over ten years ago. It included a long prologue of complicated 
relationships. Maybe it began the day I took this picture:

In 2013, it became clear my friend would die. In December, I came to Tacoma to care for her as she did, 
and to give our daughter everything we could through the crisis and beyond. My friend's father had other 
plans.

# The alleged crime

It meant the world to step out to a New Year's party with good friends. I asked everyone about the 
toughest year of their life, cuz I had just finished mine. I got wild singing about the hard year behind 
me, and good one ahead.

I barely remember the deed Lindquist called a crime. I have no dispute it was a very bad idea, but it was 
never a crime. I was very tired and buzzing from caffiene after a heck of a party. I chose the wrong 
words. In a career of trying to choose the right ones, I picked the wrong ones, not based on my meaning, 
but because of another interpretation, probably obvious in any other state of mind. It was incredibly late 
and I was incredibly worn out when I wrote seven words and fell asleep.

# Scary police reports

It takes work to translate a Facebook post into an arrest warrant. Three people worked hard to get to that 
point. Two were dishonest, and one was in over her head.

# Dishonest everybody

Lindquist took a terrible case to trial. At first blush, when he went on television, he seemed to have the 
ingredients a headline-craving prosecutor must love: A dangerous suspect, an allegation of a crime against 
a judge, and an outrageous music video.

After he got what he wanted, the prosecutor wanted me to spend more than a year in prson for seven words 
he called a crime.

[The petition contends Lindquist pays extra attention to criminal cases that receive media attention, and 
seeks harsher penalties for defendants in such 
cases.](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article26347357.html)

What he had was a deliciously *specious* case.

**specious**: *misleading in appearance, especially misleadingly attractive.*

(If you want to understand narcissists, write this word at the top of your notes. It's on the quiz!)

## Dishonest family lawyer

The first contact to law enforcement was made by an attorney. Great start! Attorneys are truthful, right?

On the witness stand, my attorney asked her to measure the level of fear she felt toward me, and she swore 
it was 4 out of 5. Pretty scary. So we pressed play on this recording.

*embed*

After it played, she sure looked freaked. She confirmed her 4-of-5 fear metric, and repeated a dorky line, 
"We don't know what he's capable of!" We do know she's capable of going from bored to terrified sometime 
*after* calling the police on the non-emergency contact line.
And we know the Prosecutor knew or should have known there was clear evidence that strongly 
contradicted her claim of 
mortal fear.

## Dishonest dad

Key to the sexy news report is the fantastically false police report quoting Emily's dad, a retired 
fireman. His claims were particularly skillful. His credentials as a recent retiree of the fire department 
probably enhanced his believability with the interviewing officer. Here's the report:


He's so dishonest that it's boring. And yet the prosecutor insisted on a trial. Why he hates me relates to 
some abnormal psychology that I might explain later. (just a collection of fire chief, for now) What 
matters here is: The prosecutor claimed he read the surreal panorama of accusations and insinuations filed 
in the custody dispute. Yet he still wanted a trial.

## Excited G.A.L. in too deep

The bar is pretty low for family law attorneys. In my criminal case in addition to Ms. Young's obvious 
dishonesty, the woman representing the child got in way too deep, and very obviously violated the Rules of 
Professional Conduct. She cooperated with the police, which was her right, but then kept her involvement a 
secret from the custody judge. Her feeble, ignorant defense of her actions shows that she doesn't 
understand the basics of this transgression:

She must have read 200 pages of hostile accusations against me. Nowhere in any was there any accusation of 
violence. But I think she got whipped up by the excitement of a police investigation. It made her feel 
significant. The judge fired her. She still appears unaware why.

A prosecutor shouldn't go to trial with liars and looneys claiming to be victims. I don't think a smart 
prosecutor would have done so.

## The rest

The charges specified 3 others who the prosecutor claimed were victims. Details differ, but two said 
basically they didn't see the message as a serious threat, and the judge called the 6th person "brittle". 
It's worth noting that the prosecutor dug up 7 people as victims, and in 7 distinct instances, the judge 
said nope. That's not one error, but 7 errors in the prosecutor's judgement, isn't it?

# Desperate, he doubles down

Every day I'm sure a prosecutor's office meets people trying to trick them into something. It's critically 
important they get past the dishonesty. Lindquist's office did not, and so a judge did it for them. In the 
mean time, so much court time and tax money was wasted. But when you speak inappropriately to the press, 
as Lindquist did, you can't just drop it. It's so similar to his deplorable committment to hiding his 
Public Record text messages. He doubles down on bad ideas.

From beginning to end, my case was handled by a deputy named Patrick Cooper. Since losing the case against 
me, he has been promoted. This is consistent with my belief that I was tried to reduce risk Lindquist 
incurred with his false and prohibited statements to the press. Loyalty, not success, was Cooper's valued 
contribution.

I believe the deputy prosecutor must have noticed he was being tricked, but he also knew his boss went on 
the TV and said what he said to the press. He does that a lot, but it's still wrong.

I remember the deputy prosecutor looking at me intensely after piling on the charges on the day the trial 
began. He had just "thrown the book" at me. Why? Because that's what prosecutors do? Perhaps. But before 
the trial, in a pre-trial motion, my counsel proved that the threat against the judge was literally 
impossible, because he wasn't my judge when I typed those words.

To be accused of threatening to murder a judge I had only great feelings toward was particularly insulting 
and surreal. The judge had studied all the documents in my custody case, and ruled unequivocally that the 
opposing attorney's request was without merit. And Lindquist's deputy was going to argue I wanted to 
communicate a murder threat? It was insane. I found the judge involved to be brilliant and adorable, fully 
deserving of his esteemed position as the county's lead justice.

People in civil court often love the idea of involving the police. It can give a huge advantage to their 
lot in civil court when they opposing party is in jail, or silent due to their Fifth Amendment right to be 
so. Any sound prosecutor would see bright yellow flags when a party in a civil case insists they're 
victims of a crime perpetrated by their opponent. But this prosecutor went on TV, and I believe that 
prevented him from ever having a come-to-Jesus moment about the quality of his case.

Most cases settle without a trial. Those cases don't result in RPC complaints like mine. But I endured a 
trial, I was completely acquitted at trial, and so I have a rare opportunity to call out his behavior.

Due to a flurry of wild accusations in my custody case, I was blessed to have met for ten hours with 
Washington's top expert in violent criminals. He is the coolest person I've met in a while. He 
unequivocally declared that I'm a harmless person. An enormous body of evidence confirmed that. Additional 
evidence from the people Mark called victims also pointed to flim-flam and bamboozle. But I don't think 
the facts mattered to the prosecution. I think they needed a conviction at any cost, because it weakened 
any claim I might make about the appropriateness of Mark's statements to the press. They didn't understand 
I couldn't just take a small charge, as it would substantially weaken my custody case.

## My testimony

[You can read my testimony and words from my accusers](http://tucc.us/dtm_cop_lies.html).

Testifying wasn't fun, but it was heartening. The surreal accusations made no sense in the face of the 
truth.

# Speciousness is a narcissist go-to ploy

I'm gonna riff a little about narcissists. It's a word that gets thrown around a lot, when we talk about 
the President, and the Prosecutor. It's something more than just a self-centered person. It's someone who 
is disturbingly self-centered. A narcissist is so self-centered that they will do *anything* to make you 
focus on them, and their explanation of events. Specious claims are popular with narcissists because they 
give them sheen and shimmer. Who cares what's true? What matters to them is what might seem true right now 
that makes them look maximally good.

When you try to understand how Lindquist dug so deep hiding his misbehavior from Nissen, just think how 
well he hid the truth, and for how long. The ability to win now and look like a hero now is like a drug to 
narcissists. They'll tell enormous lies to do it. Many lies hide the truth well... for a while. A 
narcissist is in such a psychological panic about building up their image now that they'll grab at 
whatever lie helps. They'll save later for later.

A narcissist is dangerous because they will reject any explanation that doesn't revolve around them, and 
they're often very persuasive with you about believing it. But that primarily goes for weak people, broken 
people, and those who want to believe.

# The custody dispute

My friend and I did everything we could to assure her daughter would be raised according to her wishes. 
But my friend's father did everything he could legally do--and then some--to subvert her wishes. An insane 
custody court battle ensued.

# "Rounded him up"

As you see in [the Bar Complaint](bc.html), one Friday at lunch I learned I was a wanted man. As I explain 
in that Complaint, I was incredibly cooperative with the authorities. I considered not leaving Seattle 
that Friday, knowing a Friday arrest means a weekend in jail. I resent very much the way Mark Lindquist 
ignored my obvious cooperation when crafting his fantasy fiction about those events.

# Long weekend in jail

Any weekend in jail is a long one. I met some good people there. I felt uncomfortable walking around, and 
mostly stayed in my bunk. The mattress I had was terrible, and my back hurt a lot. Eventually I swapped it 
for a better one that wasn't in use.

On arraignment day, many prisoners were called to a side room to talk with legal assistants. I was the 
only one who explained I had private counsel.

# Arraignment

Arraignment is an exciting time for accused prisoners. A lot of people learn there that no charges will be 
filed against them--they're going home soon.

Arraignment is also a change of company. I had been kept in the non-violent area. At arraignment, I made 
the acquaintence of some scary dudes. I also remember a uniquely brilliant man, a mathmetician with an 
advanced degree and opioid addiction. He was highly respected among prisoners because he knew the 
sentencing guidelines. A prisoner could tell him his criminal history, and he could estimate what the 
arraignment judge would do. How much your bail will be is the only question anyone has for the arraignment 
judge, and this guy's obvious skill at estimating was very valued. But he couldn't figure my case until 
clues emerged.

As each person was called from the arraignment holding cell before the judge, we'd wish them success. On 
their return, we'd ask how it went. They may have just learned they risk years in a prison, or would 
be 
going home soon, so the excitement was palpable, and most were enthusiastic to share. Two phrases common 
to jail were repeated in that pen: *some bullshit* and *it is what it is*.

I'll pause here to point out something you might not realize about jail. In my day, especially in Seattle, 
face-to-face interaction must compete with mobile phones showing social media and the rest of the vast 
internet. In jail, people interact, and are largely returned to a human's normal state of curiousity about 
others, and an eagerness to interact, even with strangers. I joked with the math whiz that people pay good 
money for a Buddhist retreat where there are no mobile devices and cable TVs.

I remember a man whose common-law wife had turned him in days after she says he harmed her. She was in the 
gallery at the arraignment yelling how much she missed him, and how she wanted him back. He explained that 
he did 19 years for a murder he didn't commit, and had given enough of his life to the state. He was a 
physically intimidating figure. He talked about how much his wife drinks, and how she gets out of control 
and becomes another person. Three prisoners gathered close to him while the math whiz explained that his 
wife is an alcoholic, and can't control her drinking like many can. He said he wanted to get out of this 
country, and go to Hawaii. Nobody was going to quibble. We said that was a good plan.

As men returned from seeing the judge, details emerged. Someone noticed a television camera. Through lore 
and logic they knew there must be someone accused of a notorious crime. The math whiz also explained that 
a judge in front of a camera is dangerous, because they must appear tough for the television audience. 
Eventually, Math Whiz and I noticed everyone else but me had faced the judge. He eventually concluded, 
"They must be here for you. You're the Sacrificial Lamb!" I guess this was the hardest moment of my 
interaction with Pierce County's criminal justice system. Math Whiz, who was also a Seventh Day Adventist, 
quoted some theology that brought me some comfort.

I didn't dare wave or smile. In hindsight I wish I did. Anyone who knows me knows I'm not inclined to 
threats or violence, and would much rather make a friend. Tim Leary came to mind, always smiling becaue he 
knew the medium is the message. But the judge was already motivated by the television cameras to show 
dominance over the lawless danger she was told I represented. So I stuck with a stoic face.

To this day, I compare my bail, $75,000, or "seventy five racks" to that of other accused. Back in 
lock-up, this sum made me revered. I must be some criminal to merit that much bail, especially with no 
priors. One charismatic man invited me to share with his group what my crime was. "They claim I threatened 
to murder a judge!" Listeners loved this. "But I didn't do it!" Of course, they said. None of us did.

# Leaving jail

At the exit to the jail, an officer behind some plexiglass returned my personal property. I tried to open 
the door to leave, but there wasn't a handle. "That's kind of the point," she said. She hit the buzzer and 
I was free.

# TV news

That night my family drove me to SeaTac, where I lived. I saw the television broadcast on the internet 
before I left the car. Of course the music video made visual and scary news, when added to the false 
police reports. But Mark Lindquist's extrajudicial comments were icing on the cake for KIRO editors. 
*Considered me a threat. Didn't wait. Rounded me up.* What an illusion of efficacy he provided, a series 
of false statements, made publically at the expense of my reputation, and obviously endangering my right 
to a fair trial. Yeah, Champ. He said what he thought would keep his job safe. Truth was secondary, and he 
thought it was OK to risk everything else as collateral damage.

I walked into my job in downtown Seattle on Tuesday. Nobody noticed I had missed Monday, and nobody even 
saw the news broadcast. For a time, I occupied both the realm of Seattle high-tech, and the realm of 
Pierce County's accused felons.

Weeks later, a man was trying to recruit me to support the data analytics division of a global 
entertainment leader. He realized that he had seen me on the news. He said it was unlikely that I would be 
hired based on what he knew.

# Out on bail

When Mark Lindquist came into my life,, I was recovering from the most enormous blow of my life. He piled 
a lot of pain on top. It was impersonal pain, the fear of the state's awesome power to accuse and 
incarcerate. Don't underestimate the power of accusations to fuck up your life. I lost a valuable job lead 
because the recruiter had seen the television news. (The press had a right to film me, but Lindquist 
violated three rules governing prosecutors with his contributions.) The deputy prosecutor would show up 
unprepared for hearings, forcing us to reschedule.


When Emily died, he moved me onto his livingroom futon, and I couldn't move anymore. I had worked so hard, 
from dawn to night, to keep Emily alive and our daughter emotionally well. I have 220 pages documentation 
of these days written by the hospice staff that I can't read yet. In the midst of it, and before, Emily's 
dad already began his freaky dirty tricks on us. As she lost walking ability, he was already crafting lies 
and panics to subvert us, but again, that's a story for another day. It made us both incredibly angry. We 
never missed a single chemotherapy or a family therapy session. Sometimes her dad would show up with his 
wives to abuse me in family therapy. Never saw him at chemo. Never saw him in the house as she fell dying.

I'm saying here that I was already emotionally broken when Mark charged me with 7 threats to murder.

My brother had generously housed me in his basement apartment, but as an accused felon, I had to leave due 
to agreements in his child's immediate family: no felons, convicted or otherwise! So I had to move to my 
older brother's garage attic. It's not suitable housing, but he does have a laid back mindset, sitting at 
a little table in his front yard, using a lazy susan to separate blue glass from gravel, a blend of glass 
and gravel Home Depot intentionally pre-blended. Both crises brought me much closer to my family.

Eventually I got back to the singing groups Emily and I enjoyed before I moved to Tacoma. It was so 
strange to feel safe and respected in Seattle again, while shuttling to Tacoma to face down the 
intransigence of the prosecuting attorney, and endless dishonest schemes of Darin Murphy and Heather 
Young. It became a double life for a while.

# The recall effort

Try to imagine my surprise when I'm out on bail and learn that citizens have accused Lindquist of serious 
offenses in office, most notably an unhealthy pattern of going on TV to talk about people accused of 
crimes. In my own county (King), the prosecutor might be visible after a conviction--after all his work 
culminates in a persuaded jury. In legal terms, the difference between public statements about the accused 
vs. the convicted is a huge one.

My family quickly joined the movement to remove Lindquist. My mom may have gathered a hundred signatures 
to round him up and send him packing.

In a way, America gives many elected officials 4 years to screw up. We rarely remove officials during 
their term. Rather, we just find someone better at the next election. Recalls are notoriously complicated 
to achieve, and I admire how hard so many worked at this high goal. We all should recognize that the 
recall cleared the first and most serious hurdle: A judge agreed there was enough evidence to believe Mark 
Lindquist has committed offenses serious enough to merit a recall effort. According to that judge, it is 
very likely this official committed acts that merit removal from office. Since then, the evidence has 
grown stronger and louder.

# SCOTUS and me

Being out on bail is surreal. Being on bail for a speech crime was another level. Anything I said anywhere 
could be used against me.

I remember how surreal it became when the Supreme Court ruled in my favor, in a case incredibly similar to 
my own. While the nation celebrated the marriage equality ruling, the SCOTUS ruling on *Alonis v. USA* was 
as significant to speech advocates. In a case much more heinous and much more clear, the Supremes ruled 
there was no real threat because there was no intention to threaten. Surely this meant the prosecutor 
would drop the charges. And had he not gone on TV and said those things, I bet he would have.

# See Before my verdict

As it happens, my parents are Pierce County Democrats since forever. The day before my verdict, we 
attended a Dem fundraiser in downtown Tacoma. By pure luck, my assigned seat faced Mark. What a surreal 
moment that was for me. He rode his phone all evening long. What a bizarre and insulting argument he made 
to our state's Supreme Court, that the ownership of the phone was a loophole in our laws governing public 
officials. I never asked any judge to believe something so outrageous. He spent tax funds lavishly on his 
ridiculous position. My family spent painfully to counter his ridiculous claim that I should be 
incarcerated. And it was a surreal culmination, to watch him ride his phone all evening, as a recall 
petition drive threatened him in the street, and I studied and derided his fat head and crazy eyes from 
fifteen feet away. He's a danger because he thinks only he matters. Whatever else is going on, he wants to 
make it about him. He'll put you in a prison if he thinks that's what it takes to keep him safely in the 
public eye.

# The verdict

Lindquist lost, rather spectactularly. The judge convicted me of nothing. The deputy prosecutor who 
handled every aspect of my case from the arrest warrant to the verdict was promoted. I guess Lindquist 
loves loyalty. Performance must come in somewhere lower on the list.

# See Implications of Lindquist's position

Mark accused me of a speech crime. Speech crimes do exist, and I got to learn all about them. The law 
calls the crime he tried me for a *true threat*. You know what I think: He tried me because he went on TV 
and spoke improperly about me, and had to win to paper over that bad choice. If we pretend that's untrue, 
where does that leave him? It disturbs me that an American would believe seven words could and should 
result in seven felonies and over a year behind bars. Any seven words just aren't enough to determine 
intended meaning. Next you'll see him trying someone for the work of a smartphone's auto-correct!

At one point, the prosecutor invited me to accept one misdermeanor, I think it was... I should check. And 
then invited me to specify another outcome and avoid a trial. I asked him to just walk away. In criminal 
court, you deal with a deputy prosecutor, but my attorney explained that there are no trials unless Mark 
Lindquist insists on one. Mark couldn't walk away. How many times have we seen that before? With how many 
obsessions, pertaining to how many abuses of his authority within the press and within law enforcement? He 
gets obsessed and he can't let go.

This guy, who wrote some novels, believed in criminalizing speech, long after it was clear the people who 
called it in were charlitans. This must happen to prosecutors every day. People in conflicts want to drop 
a dime on the other party, and make them sound terrible. There really usually are at least two sides. But 
when you go on TV and talk out your ass about the accused, you can't do the right thing anymore, and just 
drop the charges. So Mark doubled down.

He's either prone to bungles where his mouth gets him in trouble, or he's all for criminalizing 
accidental, unfortunate speech, so long as some stooges will claim to be victims in his fantasy before a 
judge. One of those must be true.

That troubles me. When you compare my case of alleged (and now disproven) felony harassment to other 
cases, there's no comparison. Facts of actual felony harassment include details I remember, like 5 hours 
of death threat text messages, or lengthy, wordy screeds on email that very, very clearly say, "I will 
kill you."

As you see from my testimony at trial, my mind was hazy, not focused, and my thinking was metaphorical, 
not literal. One would think an "author-lawyer" would be the first to comprehend how this might happen, 
but he was the last.

Maybe Mark is obsessed with this particular crime. It's a unique kind of crime, where symbols and words 
are the actual crime. According to documents, Mark Lindquist [became obsessed with the idea that Glenda 
Nissen committed this same crime](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article26298505.html) by 
sending a death threat to Mary Robnett, even though no forensic evidence tied her to it, and other details 
didn't point to her, either. Maybe as a writer of pulp fiction, he's unusually attached to words. Perhaps. 
But really, I think it's deeper than that. I think Mark has the kind of connection to words and symbols 
that we see in our President. In a post-factual world, symbols don't represent or misrepresent the truth. 
Symbols become truth! It's disturbing.

Once I came to know who Mark Lindquist is, and study his activities further, I came to expect his 
two-sentence condemnations of criminal incidents in the fake or real press, on KIRO FM, or on the TV news. 
This is a guy who thinks he can reach more people with two sentences than with something longer. This is a 
guy who would see the potential for fear from seven words.

I think the whole thing stinks of perception management, and an unhealthy obsession with tweet-length 
ideas. That's disturbing and dangerous, and must not be the future of law enforcement at the highest 
levels.

As a professional writer, I can comprehend how uniquely powerful a few words can be. As a citizen, I'm 
disturbed by how deeply Lindquist engages in shaping perceptions with just a few words, precisely because 
I don't think the Prosecutor should be so wrapped up in perceptions. The Prosecutor should be wrapped up 
in the totality of facts! Convictions, not arrests, should enthuse a prosecutor. It's like Pierce County 
has chosen a prosecutor who sees the job like an appearance on American Idol. It's a mismatch, it's 
disturbing, and it makes me believe the Pierce County judiciary is the only thing preventing a total 
collapse of justice.


# See Bar complaint

It took a very long time before the facts of my bar complaint came into focus. Lindquist has an "absolute 
right" to try me, and I have no recourse regarding the extreme expense he burdened onto my family. But why 
did he go on TV? And what did he say about me there? I would come to understand his statements were clear, 
unequivocal violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, standard national rules that govern all 
lawyers, with special rules for prosecutors.

One of his "critics", an [unusually accomplished attorney named Bertha 
Fitzer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B99TXZsyu_78aGxibWQ5cXhBQlk/view), said Lindquist doesn't 
understand which kinds of activities are and are not violations of the RPC. My theory is that he just 
can't say no to TV cameras and exposure. If he had the discipline to only speak about the convicted, this 
would be fine, but he doesn't discriminate between the convicted and the merely accused. I think that's a 
clue to a lack of discipline and moral character. At my job in the high tech field, I'd love to pass off 
vaporware as my finished work. But that's now how engineering works. That's not how any honest bragging 
works. You do the job, and then you brag. I don't think Lindquist cares enough about what's true, and goes 
with whatever seems cool to say at the moment. That's consistent with a background in reality-inspired 
fiction. It's also incredibly unjust for people caught up in his plans. Once accused, I couldn't even 
respond to him without risking danger. Based on my own experience, and having studied the claims of his 
many critics, I have the sense he doesn't believe in fighting fair.

## More abuse

My family cautions me that Mark tries to hurt people who get in his way. The Busto investigation made this 
pattern incredibly clear. He chose to break the rules governing lawyers when he spoke about me to the 
press. He chose to try me based on the risk that his abuse would result in bad press or censure from the 
Bar Association. Now that I've been acquitted and have come forward, he may seek to abuse me more. His 
attorney, Mr. Fogg, demeans complainants in the press when justifying Mark's bad behavior. Mark engaged in 
cybersquatting to undermine the campaign of a political opponent. Obsessed, he abused Ms. Nissen and Ms. 
Dalsing using powerful County resources. And the Busto Report concluded his public statements in response 
to Mr. Merrival's whisleblower complaint were knowingly false and abusive.

So my family is wise. It won't surprise me when he maligns me again, questions my motives or sanity or 
something, and of course Mr. Fogg will insist Mark's misbehavior is consistent with prosecutors over 
decades. In a word, that's [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting). But if I remained 
silent, I would be turning my back on the remarkably brave people who have already stood up to him. What 
he did to me, he's done to many, including many who lacked the resources I have to resist.

# See Public opprobrium

One of the Rules of Professional Conduct insists that statements to a large audience by a prosector about 
a defendant should not risk raising *public opprobrium* about the accused. I laugh about this term. It 
just means words that make the public hate you. Even truthful words may be prohibited under this Rule. The 
accused is supposed to get silence from the prosecutor, so an impartial jury can be found. And the 
prosecutor's case should be made to the court, not to the news-watching public.

I remembered throughout the many hearings and the trial, I thought, "Dude, if you'd just drop this, I'd 
walk away. You aren't the reason I'm here. You know your department got conned. You know you spoke some 
terse, false, and maligning words about me. You don't know (yet) that my own verbal cannons can train on 
you, too. You don't know it yet, but I, too, can raise public opprobrium toward your performance. You 
slandered me based on seven words. I'm taking you down based on seven years. Fair's fair, I guess. If 
that's how you wanna do this, OK."

Now I've found a measure of fun and comfort assuming the persona of [Fake Mark 
Lidquist](https://twitter.com/FakeMkLindquist/), the image-obsessed media hound who has hurt doe eyes for 
everyone who isn't impressed with his badgering, cruel treatment of defendants and subordinants alike. I 
borrow from the clear words of credible sources in court documents and official memoes. It's a turkey 
shoot, because at this point the patterns of narcissistic abuse within the Prosecutor's Office are 
numerous and clear. And I worry that people who can't laugh might succumb to despair. I remember that 
right now there's a guy in jail who couldn't fight back against illicit prosecutor behavior as I have 
done.

# See The custody trial

I didn't prevail. The sharpest fact in my failure was the time of Emily's death. Had she lived another six 
months, I would be in Pierce County, doing everything Emily asked me to do there.

# Ongoing opprobium

Anyone who googles my name sees this. I don't let it bug me. I really did write those words, and associate 
them with that video. And I was called a father in the goofiest news report about me, ever.

The dishonest police reports should not have been accepted as fact, but I understand how and why it 
happened. Still, did Lindquist need to say to the press that investigators consider me a threat? No, and 
it's a clear violation of the that should govern him. Now that the court rejected his claim, I don't see 
him going on TV to correct his earlier statements. He thinks he makes TV for a living. The facts come 
second.

# We can. Will we?

In democracy, citizens need to make the history, through real and overwhelming effort.

I always had a healthy skepticism about the clarity of claims made to a court, and by law enforcement on 
television. Now I know for a certainty that some officials make deeply misleading statements, and once 
made, stand by their untrue words to the bitter end. Lindquist has followed this pattern through more 
controversies than my own. In government especially, our nation is only as good as its leaders. There's no 
magical sure thing that keeps terrible decisionmakers out of power. Terrible people often seek power. Some 
people think it's their birthright to rule, even without accountability or results. Democracy's 
tools--including institutions like an independent court, a free press, regular elections, and standards 
for lawyers enforced by the Bar Association--are society's mechanisms to remove terrible leaders. There's 
absolutely no guarantee these tools will work, but they are the best we have.

# One experience, one voice

One big challenge facing people who wish to remove Lindquist from office is the inherant complexity of the 
work done by the Prosecutor's office. Most trials include a lot of details. How do voters evaluate the 
quality of the prosecutor's work without having to know all the details of a trial, enough to make an 
independent judgement. There are sensible approaches to this:

## Wins v. Losses

Associated Press broke the story on Lindquist's record on appeals, which are the best test of a trial 
lawyer's performance.

## WWWS - What would Wikipedia say?

Here's what it does say:

[Mark Lindquist, the laywer, on Wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lindquist)

I built this detailed and meticulously researched coverage of Mark's law career as an elected official.

I've been your humble servant building out this explanation. Over the years since my trial, another party 
has taken a very different approach. I've [written about the ongoing street battle](wp.html) to accurately 
reflect Mark's law career using neutral sources, vs. the person or persons who dilligently and 
intelligently sabotaged any coverage of the facts.

# Conclusion

In my exposure to Pierce County justice, I've come to the view that bad people collude to accomplish bad 
things in Pierce County, and good people struggle to stop them. That's an unsavory view, but I've seen 
enough to believe it. I hope good people can work together again here and do what's in the interest of 
real justice for everyone: The accused, the law enforcement professionals, and the victims of crime all 
deserve an honest authority. The guy in charge now needs to go home and leave justice to those whose 
committment to it is genuine. Please, embrace the necessary complexity of grinding fine to reach justice, 
and leave these dirty deals, photo ops and sound bites behind.

But here's the problem: That guy has $100,000 and a fair amount of name recognition. It's dangerously 
likely he'll be re-elected.

# A challenger and a challenge

I've never met her, but [Mary Robnett](https://maryforprosecutor.com) is clearly an eminently qualified 
candidate for this job. Due in large part to a [rock guitarist 
friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Buck), his largest campaign contributor, Mark Lindquist has 
around $100,000 he can spend on keeping his job. That's a lot. He also has name recognition, due primarily 
to enormous efforts at being seen under any pretext, even for fabricating a pretext that he didn't wait, 
that he's rounding 'em up, even when his job only begins the day of an arrest. People see his spooky face 
on all those non-journalism free press pieces. He knows that breaking the lawyer rules lets him be seen by 
large audiences, spinning poetic but unexamined accounts of events he alleges to be crimes, but hasn't had 
to prove. As a commercial fiction writer, he knows how to craft a memorable phrase about the saddest and 
scariest occurances society has to experience. I'm not the first to conclude he treats facts as optional 
in performance of prosecutor duties. Nothing about his enormous investment in fake newspapers like Tacoma 
Weekly and "arrangements" on TV news (like KIRO) makes him good at *convicting* criminals. Do you see King 
county's prosecutor on TV talking about arrested people? No, Dan talks about convictions, because a 
prosecutor's job only starts when there's an arrest. Courts stil place facts first, leaving Lindquist with 
a busted record of prosecuting poorly, expensively, and inefficiently. He doesn't really keep us safe.

Mary Robnett will not waltz into this job. Change can only come when enough people offset all that effort 
in building a PR scheme of tricks on TV and newsprint. How many millions in dirty schemes and huge fines 
will Pierce County blow on this unapologetic liar before voters realize Mark Lindquist is a threat? Don't 
wait. Round him up. Dont stop until this problem is solved in Pierce County.
