# Dishonest Complainants

Lindquist went to trial with a terrible case.
To understand why, you have to understand where it all
began: with a pretty good-looking case. A word I come
back to is *specious*, which means:

*misleading in appearance, especially misleadingly attractive.*

If you want to understand narcissists, write this word
at the top of your notes. It's key!


## Dishonest family lawyer

The first contact to law enforcement was made by an 
attorney.

In her sworn testimony, my attorney asked her to 
measure the level of fear she felt toward me, and she 
swore it was 4 out of 5. Pretty scary. So we pressed 
play on this recording.

*embed*

While it played, she made a face like she had eaten a 
worm. After it played, she repeated a dorky line, "We 
don't know what he's capable of." Apparently she must 
have become terrified sometime after calling the 
police on their non-emergency contact line.

You would hope an attorney, who is what's called "an officer of the 
court," and sworn to bring truth to it, would refrain 
from spinning a yarn like this. Ms. Young showed no 
hesitation about lying for her client. She involved 
herself in my legal cases many times in ways an honest 
attorney wouldn't. (I've been reluctant too share
this evidence, because somewhere in Tacoma, someone
needs a dishonest attorney right now, and I just helped
them find her.)

## Dishonest dad

A followup interview with a retired fireman added fuel 
to the fear fire. His claims were particularly 
skillful, which is consistent with his enormous 
committment to telling lies. Like Lindquist, he is a 
severe narcissist, with a lifetime of experience 
emotionally abusing and manipulating people. His 
credentials as a recent retiree of the fire department 
probably enhanced his believability with the 
interviewing officer. Here's a bit more about the 
actual nature of his honesty and credibility, from the 
Fire Chief:

I have many other examples of his dishonesty, in 
document after document. He's so dishonest that it's 
boring, but he's not an officer of the court like
the lying attorney. Perhaps I'll share more about him later.
For now, just see how a prosecutor shouldn't go to
trial with such severe liars.

# Lady got fired

The lady who represented the child in the custody
cause met with police about me, and withheld this fact
from the judge. This is amateur hour writ large.
Here's a doc of her claiming what she did was OK.
Of course she withholds what she did in that defense.
She withheld her participation with police from a judge
of me. She is so crazy. She got a bunch of guns.
And what a creeper. She would speak to me thoughtfully
in the hallway, but take on creepy tones when talking
about me before the judge. Like a freaky robot.
I met so many creepers in Pierce County! What a slimy
cespool of dishonesty is the Pierce County court experience.

## Prosecutor's perdicament

Alas, the full scope of the dishonesty and generations 
of abuse within his family and career is beyond the 
scope of this explanation. For now just understand 
that a prosecutor's office meets people trying to 
trick them every day, and it's critically important 
they get past the dishonesty. Lindquist's office did 
not, and so a judge did it for them. It's my view they 
didn't question their complainants (who they alleged 
to be victims) because they knew Lindquist's 
statements to the press prevented them from dropping 
the charges at all.

From beginning to end, my case was handled by a deputy 
named Patrick Cooper. Since losing the case against 
me, he has been promoted. This is consistent with my 
belief that I was tried to reduce risk Lindquist 
incurred with his false and prohibited statements to 
the press. Loyalty, not success, was Cooper's valued 
contribution.


# Speciousness is a narcissist go-to ploy

I'm gonna riff a little about narcissists. It's a word
that gets thrown around a lot, when we talk about the President,
and the Prosecutor. It's something more than just a self-
centered person. It's someone who is disturbingly self-centered.
A narcissist is so self-centered that they will do *anything*
to make you focus on them, and their explanation of events.
Specious claims are
popular with narcissists because they give them sheen
and shimmer. Who cares what's true? What matters to them
is what might seem true right now that makes them look
maximally good.

When you try to understand how Lindquist dug so deep
hiding his misbehavior from Nissen, just think how well
a major effort hid the truth, and for how long. The 
ability to win now and look like a hero now is like
a drug to narcissists. They'll tell lies to do it.
Many lies hide the truth well... for a while. A narcissist
is in such a psychological panic about building up their
image now that they'll grab at the lie that helps. They'll
save later for later. If it's specious, it will look
good today. Save tomorrow for tomorrow, as new lies
will probably appear to help.

A narcissist is dangerous because they will reject any
explanation that doesn't revolve around them, and they're 
persuasive with you about believing it.

I don't like thinking of the specious claims by Lindquist
--most recently, that his texts were 'trivial'--and how
it's certain there are people in jail now because 
plausability means more to him than the whole truth.

A few people told me I ought not dissect the psychology
at work with such specific words. I remind those people
that the Prosecutor literally went on television to 
repeat the false claim that I'm a threat, and make goofy
claims about how he hurried to apprehend me. It's like
dealing with the President: First, he started it. Second,
people making outrageous claims need to be drowned out
by more and louder people, making more reasonable claims.
I spent a lot of time keeping quiet while I was on trial,
as anything I said--even clicking Like on Facebook--could
be used by a desperate prosecutor. But now it's time for
an election, and you'all deserve to know what I know.
