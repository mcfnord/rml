<title>Dishonest - Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist</title>
# Emily died

My story began in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico over ten years ago. It included a long prologue of complicated 
relationships. Maybe it began the day I took this picture:

![](ermobit2.png)

In 2013, it became clear my friend would die. She was so much more tired. I had to be by her side for steps. I 
never minded. Everything got complicated but I never minded. In December, I came to Tacoma to be a full time 
father and partner through the crisis and beyond. After cruel suffering in hospice at home, in June, 2014, [she 
died](http://ladybug.today). The child's biological father is a bum in Florida, and her grandfather had his own 
ideas about what should happen next.

# 3am, Jan 1, 2015

It's proper for now to skip all the details of the agony of her slow death, the 18-hour days of caring for her at 
home in hospice, and 6 months of bizarre accusations in family court. Documents claim I drugged her, separated 
her from her family, stole her money, didn't love her, made child porn, and took showers with our daughter. I'm 
sure I missed some accusations. Why not throw out every creative, scary idea and see if anything sticks? There 
were also brazen, failed efforts to take control of the child's trust money. And then Mark Lindquist came into my 
life.

It meant the world to step out to a New Year's party with good friends. I asked everyone about the toughest year 
of their life, cuz I had just finished mine. I got wild singing about the hard year behind me, and good one 
ahead.

I barely remember the deed Lindquist called a crime. I have no dispute it was a very bad idea, but it was never a 
crime. I was very tired and buzzing from caffiene after a heck of a party. I chose the wrong words. In a career 
of trying to choose the right ones, I picked the wrong ones, not based on my meaning, but because of another 
interpretation, probably obvious in any other state of mind. It was incredibly late and I was incredibly worn out 
when I wrote seven words and fell asleep. The prosecutor wanted me to spend more than a year in prison for those 
seven words.

# See Scary police reports

It takes work to translate a Facebook post into an arrest warrant. Three people worked hard to get to that point. 
Two were dishonest, and one was in over her head.

## Dishonest family lawyer

The first contact to law enforcement was made by an attorney. Great start! Attorneys are truthful, right?

On the witness stand, my attorney asked her to measure the level of fear she felt toward me, and she swore it was 
4 out of 5. Pretty scary. So we pressed play on the recording of her call to the police. She sure looked freaked 
out as it played, perhaps because in the recording, she sounded bored and annoyed (she always sounds annoyed). 
After it played, she confirmed her 4-of-5 fear metric, and repeated a dorky line, "We don't know what he's 
capable of!" We do know she's capable of going from bored to terrified sometime *after* calling the police on the 
non-emergency contact line. And we know the prosecutor must have reviewed this evidence that strongly 
contradicted her claim of mortal fear. Isn't that what Mark meant by _ongoing investigation?_

## Dishonest dad

Key to the scary news report is the fantastically false police report quoting Emily's dad, a retired fireman. 
He worked particularly hard to [sound scary](http://ladybug.today/dtm_cop_lies.html).

Why he hates me relates to some abnormal psychology that I might explain later. He's so dishonest that it's 
boring. What matters here is: The prosecutor claimed he read the surreal panorama of accusations and insinuations 
filed in the custody dispute. He must have concluded eventually the claims highlighted by KIRO were false. Yet he still 
insisted on a trial.

## Excited G.A.L. in too deep

The bar is pretty low for family law attorneys. In my criminal case in addition to one attorney's obvious 
dishonesty, the woman representing the child got in way too deep, and obviously violated the Rules of 
Professional Conduct. She cooperated with the police, which was her right, but then kept her involvement a secret 
from the custody judge. This got her fired. And she wrote a defense of her actions in which she doesn't seem to 
understand why she was fired by the judge.

She must have read 200 pages of hostile accusations against me. Nowhere in any was there any accusation of 
violence. But I think she got whipped up by the excitement of a police investigation. It made her feel 
significant.

## The rest

The charges specified 4 others who the prosecutor claimed were victims. Two said basically they didn't see the 
message as a serious threat, and the judge called one person "brittle".

To be accused of threatening to murder a judge I had only great feelings toward was particularly insulting and 
surreal. I found him to be brilliant, fully deserving of his esteemed position as the county's lead justice.

I never intended to communicate a threat to murder, and intent is a critical part of felony law. Some of the 
people who claimed to be victims worked very hard to project criminal intent upon me. Upon realizing this, the 
prosecutor should have quit the whole thing. ([Mark knows how intent works in felony 
law.](http://komonews.com/news/local/prosecutors-want-harsh-punishment-for-teen-suspects-in-accidental-gunfire-at-tacoma-school)) 
Instead, Mark Lindquist dug up 7 people as victims, and in 7 distinct instances, the judge said nope. That's not 
one error, but 7 errors in judgement. That record is a crappy use of County resources. Why did Mark make these 
choices? Let me explain why Lindquist's choices with the media prevented him from doing the right thing.

# See The recall campaign

Imagine my surprise when I'm out [on bail](televised.html) and learn that citizens have accused Lindquist of 
serious offenses in office, most notably an unhealthy pattern of going on TV to talk about people accused of 
crimes.

*[The petition contends Lindquist pays extra attention to criminal cases that receive media attention, and seeks 
harsher penalties for defendants in such cases.](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article26347357.html)*

In my own county (King), the prosecutor might be visible after a conviction--after all his work culminates in a 
persuaded jury. In legal terms, the difference between public statements about the accused vs. the convicted is a 
huge one. An arrest might be the culmination of police work, but it's literally step One for a prosecutor. That's 
when his work *begins*. *Convictions* are the proper measure of a good prosecutor. And by that metric, 
Lindquist's record is terrible.

![](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/suxd2q/picture29747860/alternates/LANDSCAPE_768/recall%20A1)

The recall cleared the first and most serious hurdle
: A judge agreed there was enough evidence 
to believe Mark Lindquist has
[committed offenses that merit removal from office](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article30432828.html). Since then, the evidence has 
grown much stronger.

# SCOTUS and me

While I was on bail, the Supreme Court ruled in my favor, in a case incredibly similar to my own. While the 
nation celebrated the marriage equality ruling, the SCOTUS ruling on *[Alonis v. 
USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elonis_v._United_States)* was as significant to speech advocates. In a case 
much more heinous than my seven words, the Supremes ruled there was no real threat because there was no intention 
to threaten. I thought at the time that surely the prosecutor would drop the charges in light of the Supremes' 
affirmation that felonies require *mens rea*, or *the guilty mind*. And had he not gone on TV and said those 
things, I bet he would have dropped it.

# Loyalty first

From beginning to end, my case was handled by a deputy named Patrick Cooper. Since losing the case against me, he 
has been promoted. This is consistent with my belief that I was tried to reduce risk Lindquist incurred with his 
false and prohibited statements to the press. Loyalty, not success, was Cooper's valued contribution.

# See Perception v. Reality

At first blush, when Mark went on television, he seemed to have the ingredients a headline-craving prosecutor 
must love: A dangerous suspect, an allegation of a crime against a judge, and an outrageous music video.

What he had was a deliciously *specious* case.

**specious**: *misleading in appearance, especially misleadingly attractive.*

When Pierce County paid for a report on Lindquist's poor leadership skills, Mark hired James Lynch II. Mr. Lynch 
has worked for Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney's Office full-time for almost two years. Do you know how Mr. 
Lynch describes his work? (I've added **bold**.)

_Communications expert with extensive experience and a proven ability to **shape perceptions** and manage media 
relationships. Direct public outreach, handle crisis communications and develop press releases. Leverage 
interpersonal skills to build strong stakeholder relationships and lead high-performance teams. Research and 
write **creative stories**. Produce and promote special projects across diverse media. Use digital tools, Internet 
resources and social media to skillfully deliver clear, concise, informative messaging._

Mr. Lindquist seems to believe he has been misunderstood. I believe he has been understood very well. He has 
methodically developed ways to raise his profile in local tabloids and social media. He uses these channels to 
present explanations that strongly contradict conclusions made by outsiders. While it looks fun, it's not a good 
look for a prosecutor, whose first duty is to the court and its Rules of Professional Conduct. I don't think 
there is any role for elected officials who emphasize perception-shaping in such a clear conflict with the 
reality of their job performance. Lawyers in public office should probably be the last to participate in such 
[dishonest campaigns to mislead the public](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article197782954.html) about 
their job performance.

Karen Peterson was the executive editor of the _Tacoma News Tribune_. About Lindquist, she said:

_"[Ordinarily](http://archive.seattleweekly.com/news/962174-129/the-storybook-rise-of-the-pierce), I would not write a nearly full-page column explaining our news-gathering process and relationship with a source. However, the prosecutor’s office decided last week to publicly 
accuse this newspaper and its individual staff members of misleading the public and withholding information. [I]t falls right in line with the way this prosecutor has 
conducted business almost since the day we started covering him. He and his staff are never to be questioned. **It’s always someone else’s fault.** Apparently now it’s our turn."_

_The paper had at first listened to his complaints and over time met with the prosecutor to discuss differences, Peterson said. "But since we published the first Dalsing story on June 22, 2014, he has been relentless in his demands for changes in a way I’ve encountered from no other source in my 30 years in this business."_

_Nonetheless, more meetings ensued, along with day and night calls from Lindquist’s office to reporters, until the prosecutor’s office was seemingly attempting to dictate the opening paragraphs of stories. "This was no longer about correcting the record," Peterson wrote, "but shaping it."_

Perhaps it's unsurprising that the Wikipedia page for Mark has experienced repeated vandalism attacks from [anonymous but suspicious](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mark_Lindquist&oldid=828668826#Vandalism_originating_from_Pierce_County_ISP) actors,
and once was defaced with a mess of [fanciful draft prose](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_Lindquist&oldid=831767408) that cited Mark himself 
and his fake news in local tabloids to explain the finer details of events in his public office career.

# See Smear factory

You can count on a certain kind of response from Mark Lindquist to any criticisms: He'll smear you. He'll malign you, impugn your motives, and argue that you're
[just plain crazy](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article41256369.html).


_After he filed his whistleblower complaint and news stories 
appeared, Lindquist had his staffers issue statements suggesting 
Merrival was a disgruntled employee, and also told staffers 
Merrival had a "meltdown."_

_Those statements were **untrue** and **designed to discredit Merrival**, Busto wrote._

_"I find that the PCPAO’s statements to the press in response to Merrival’s complaint were inaccurate and **intentionally misleading**," the report states. "Furthermore, by describing his 
behavior as a ‘meltdown,’ Lindquist suggested that Merrival’s complaint was the product of a disorder, rather than a response to perceived grievances and injustices."_

_Busto compared Lindquist’s "meltdown" statement to an earlier remark Lindquist made about Robnett, who left the prosecutor’s office in late 2011 following a disagreement with Lindquist._

_Reportedly, Lindquist said Robnett had a "breakdown."_

Now that's a lot to digest. If you disagree with him, there's something wrong with your head. His tax-payer funded attorney even [pulls these same moves for him](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article173451496.html):

*"We’ve had a series of politically motivated bar complaints filed by a single grievant."*

I love this "politically motivated" smear. Let's explore it: Long before anyone had signed on to challenge Lindquist for the office,
his attorney slung this idea that a bar complaint is politically motivated. If I think Lindquist is unqualified to touch tax funds or oversee anyone's
career, you can bet I'm "politically motivated". I say literally that he shouldn't have a law license. I lay out precisely why, by explaining what he
did to me, and concluding that he shouldn't have the power to do it to anyone. My *motive* is that he's unfit to be a *politician*. So... politically motivated? Yes, in the most honorable sense possible.

It's a short list of people with the position and 
resources to take on Lindquist, because he has a pattern of 
using and abusing his authority to hurt careers. He literally 
formed a list of defense attorneys whose **clients** faced 
[tougher 
sentences](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article29747605.html) 
because Lindquist didn't like the **attorney**.

Pierce County can do so much better.
Save sleaze-slinging and seductive smears
for tweets by President Trump.
I'm sure going public with my story and complaint to the Bar Association will evoke
 the slings and arrows of this sleazeball guy in quotes that journalists dutifully report to the public.

Having known many great leaders, I know this behavior is never a legitimate habit among them.


# See In Conclusion

Mark's improper statements to the press locked him in to prosecuting me. He was already taking criticism for 
abusing media access when my trial began. So he made a Hail Mary play. After realizing the 
Prosecutor's Office had been tricked into the arrest, he stacked up charges in a ploy to intimidate me into 
settling for a misdemeanor. Everyone takes the plea. For the love of a [mother and child](http://ladybug.today/), I didn't take the plea.

[You can read the trial testimony of myself and my accusors](http://tucc.us/dtm_cop_lies.html).

The trial judge rejected all 7 of Mark's claims of felony conduct, and didn't convict on any lesser crimes.

Dishonest men with tall tales stumble into police stations every day. Such events should not become the gristle 
of corrupt, media-hungry state attorneys like Mark Lindquist, who have the full force of the state behind them. 
The Rules of Professional Conduct establish clear ways to avoid that, but Mark thumbed his nose at those rules, 
and jeopardized the cause of justice to prop up the cause of Mark Lindquist.

Only Pierce County voters can stop this clear pattern of reckless. We know some of the names of people he has 
victimized by his malfescence: Dalsing, 
[Justice](https://twitter.com/FakeMkLindquist/status/960200235011031040?s=19), Dempsey, Nissen, Ames. We also 
know names of dangeous men who [walk 
free](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/many-pierce-county-cases-reversed-because-of-prosecutors/) 
because Lindquist broke other rules all prosecutors are expected to follow. So much for keeping us safe. 

The 
evidence is now abundantly clear, and the remedy is due: Pierce County law enforcement needs a new leader at the 
top.
