<title>Bar Complaint Response - Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist</title>

August 10, 2018

Washington State Bar Association  
1325 4th Ave, Suite 600  
Seattle, WA 98101

Dear Mr. Busby,

I've examined Mr. Fogg's letter of July 27, 
2018, and write to respond.

In my original complaint, I omitted key 
explanations pertaining to violations of RPC 
8.4. I thank Mr. Fogg for pointing this out. 
I also failed to discuss the clear 
expectations placed on lawyers by RPC 3.6's 
Comment 6. I hope this letter rectifies
these oversights.

Perhaps in an effort to provide context, Mr. 
Fogg introduces details about my criminal 
trial in Superior Court of no relevance to 
the matter before you. On April 23rd, 2018, 
an article (Exhibit 1) in Tacoma News 
Tribune reported (**emphasis** is my own):<ul>In February 2015, 
Dempsey was charged with seven counts of 
felony harassment. The charges, dismissed 
eight months later, stemmed from a separate 
child custody case filed in Pierce County.

Dempsey was the petitioner; the matter was 
contentious. While the custody case was 
active, Dempsey posted a music video on his 
Facebook time line after a New Year's Eve 
party. The video played a violent punk-rock 
song that depicted men in suits being shot 
and stabbed. Dempsey added a comment: “This 
is my plan for superior court!”

The video provided the basis for the 
harassment charges. **Dempsey was acquitted 
on all counts. Superior Court Judge Ron 
Culpepper found that Dempsey didn’t intend 
to threaten any of the specific parties in 
the case, adding that prosecutors couldn’t 
prove otherwise.**</ul>This account is more
clear, fair, and accurate than Mr. 
Fogg's curated observations. 

# Prohibited statements

These statements to the press are at issue 
in this complaint, with **emphasis** on the 
prohibited ones:

 * * **"We didn’t wait. We rounded him up."** *
 * * Lindquist said **investigators consider 
Dempsey a threat, so his office didn't wait 
to jail him.** "This is an ongoing 
investigation, but **we wanted to move quick,**" 
said Lindquist.*

## Non-defenses of prohibited statements

The Declaration for Determination of 
Probable Cause (Mr. Fogg's Exhibit A) does 
not state that investigators considered me a 
threat. An accurate statement might be that 
_alleged victims_ considered me a 
threat. Investigators only 
declare their view that I communicated felony harassment
that they expand to four counts 
apparently based on the length of a list of 
people they assembled during an apparent 
investigation. Felony harassment is not 
classified as a violent felony, 
and investigators did not declare that 
they consider me a threat. This false
claim by Mr. Lindqist violates
RPC 3.8 and RPC 8.4(f).

Mr. Lindquist's claim that he "rounded me 
up" is not information protected by RPC 3.6, 
as it is not the fact of, time, or place of 
an arrest. Rather, it's a (misleading) 
characterization of an arrest unspecific to 
any place and particular to vernacular 
typically applied to cattle. Definitions 
pertaining to humans typically involve force 
and involuntary participation, which is both 
untrue and a violation of RPC 3.8 and RPC 
8.4. Even sending a car would provide a 
stronger defense of this language than the 
facts of his "roundup" can.

Mr. Fogg claims that the statement "we moved 
quick" is protected under RPC 3.6 (b)(3). 
The actual statement by Mr. Lindquist is 
that "we wanted to move quick", an 
aspirational statement that also 
communicates alarm about the defendant, a 
violation of RPC 3.8 and RPC 8.4. RPC 3.6(b)(3) is 
clear, that a prosecutor can state that an 
investigation of a matter is in progress,
and that's all.

As well, that "we didn't wait" is not, as 
Mr. Fogg claims, "scheduling or result of 
any step in litigation" as aspiring to move 
quick is not a schedule milestone. It also 
communicates anxiety about me, which 
violates RPC 3.8 and RPC 8.4.

## Non-defenses of statements that exceed RPC 3.6

Mr. Fogg presents considerable citations 
that in no way extend protections afforded 
to prosecutors beyond the precise 
requirements of RPC 3.6.

Mr. Fogg claims:<ul>RPC 3.6(a) must function 
consistently with the generally-recognized 
duties of an elected prosecutor, which 
include educating the public about crime in 
their community, about the nature and 
reasoning behind their office's charging 
decisions, and about the criminal justice 
system generally.</ul>This does not
excuse the prohibited statements.

 * Educating the public about crime may
entail encouraging people to lock their 
doors at night, walking in well-lit areas,
and such,
 * this specific matter is not about the 
criminal justice system generally, and
 * RPC 3.6 establishes clear rules 
information disclosures that "the nature and 
reasoning behind a charging decision" cannot 
exceed.

_Functions and Duties of the Prosecutor_ 
does not extend the clear limits 
placed on prosecutors by RPC 3.6.

RPC 3.6's Comment 1 does not extend the 
clear limits placed on lawyers by RPC 
3.6. The fact, time, and place of the arrest 
and specification of charges are exactly the 
"information about legal proceedings 
themselves". Comment 1 continues that the public 
has a "right to know about threats to its 
safety and measures aimed at assuring its 
security" which again might be information 
about an at-large suspect, and additional 
patrols deployed to assure public safety. 

RPC 3.8's Comment 5 does not extend the 
clear limits placed on lawyers by RPC 
3.6. "The announcement of an indictment, 
for example, will necessarily have severe 
consequences for the accused." Such an 
announcement is limited to the fact, time, 
and place of arrest, and I agree such 
statements would have severe consequences 
for the person involved. Mr. Lindquist's 
statements that exceeeded the clear limits 
of RPC 3.6 (7)(iii) have additional severe 
consequences that are not tolerated under 
RPC rules.

## Compare to authorized statements

I've prepared this statement, which would 
not be a Rule violation:

"Alleged victims consider Dempsey a threat, 
so at our request, he appeared at the 
courthouse at 4pm and was arrested for 4 
counts of Felony Harassment. This is an 
ongoing investigation, these charges are 
only acusations, and the suspect is 
considered innocent unless and until proven 
guilty."

This statement differs from his in key ways. 
Notice:

* Strict fidelity to charging document 
claims, 
* absence of ambiguous and maligning claims
about swiftness or a need for swiftness, 
* absence 
of unspecific, misleading, maligning,
cattle-oriented 
language, 
* choice to divulge a specific 
time, place, and fact of arrest,
* a reminder that
charges are only accusations, and
* a reminder of the suspect's presumed 
innocence, as required by RPC 3.6 Comment 6.

# With effort, I waived my jury right

Mr. Fogg appears confused regarding my 
waiving a jury trial due to Mr. Lindquist's 
prohibited statements. The fact is that I 
waived the jury at the appropriate time to 
do so, and with much effort. His Exhibit E 
documents the sequence of events. On 
September 22nd, I waived my right to a jury. 
On September 28, the next day of pre-trial 
acitivities, Judge Culpepper said he could 
not act as finder of fact because he is a 
friend of Judge Tollefson, the esteemed 
jurist named in my most serious charge. That 
afternoon, I argued successfully that the 
offense against Judge Tollefson _could not 
have occurred_, thus eliminating that charge 
via pre-trial motion. With it eliminated, I 
was able to waive my right to a jury a 
second and final time before the trial 
began.

I shudder when hearing Mr. Fogg seek a 
procedural dismissal based on my success 
waiving my peer jury, whose jury pool Mr. 
Lindquist poisoned with his widely 
distributed prohibited statements. Far from 
cause for your dismissal, that I felt it 
necessary to waive my jury trial at 
considerable effort and some risk of failure 
should give pause to any advocate of justice 
who values every defendant's right to a 
jury, a right often called the "gold 
standard of American criminal justice".

# Speculation of malevolent motives

I strongly dispute Mr. Fogg's claim that my 
motive is animosity toward "Lindquist, the 
PCPAO, and the justice system generally". My 
feelings are unrelated to the questions 
before the Bar. However, Mr. Fogg's 
misappraisal deserves additional response. 

 * I'm reminded of my upbringing in the 
house my parents built on 200th Street in 
Spanaway. My father's service revolver hung 
heavy in its holster in a message to this 
toddler that the forces of emnity are 
serious, and that my father risked his own 
life daily to credibly oppose lawlessness 
and the darkest forces among men. This year, 
a different Pierce County Sheriff was killed 
on duty on 200th Street standing against 
malevolent forces.
 * I'm reminded of my Presidency of Spanaway 
Lake High School, where I was elected on a 
platform, and duty-bound to contribute my 
best judgement in service of my constituents.
 * I'm reminded of Sgt. Emily Rose Murphy, 
USMC, an eight year Marine Corps veteran 
(Nov 7, 1980 - Jun 2, 2014) who spoke 
plainly about me raising her child. (Exhibit 2) I think of her drive and committment to 
defend liberty until brain cancer tore her 
from active service. When I was caring for 
her in hospice, we said often to each other, 
"Semper Fi, do or die." _Semper fidelis_, the Marine Corps motto, 
means "always faithful". Honesty is a 
requirement for faithfulness, and hope is a 
necessary ingredient to abide by this motto.
 * I'm reminded of my career in technical 
writing in the software industry. where good 
words convey a helpful understanding and 
enable progress, while bad words obscure key 
facts, and lead to engineering failures and 
huge expenses.

# Attacks on irrelivant speech

Mr. Fogg has located a website I maintain. 
I've included one document he mentions, 
_Malfeasance Guide_, as Exhibit 3. Among 
other entries, this Guide includes a summary 
and browser-based presentation of the letter 
you provided to Mr. Lindquist explaining 
your decision to recommend a public 
disciplinary hearing, now scheduled for 
December.

In Footnote 7, Mr. Fogg identifies an 
account and specific tweet on Twitter.com 
where I present a caricature of Mr. 
Lindquist, and lampoon and satarize him. The 
specific tweet employs hyperbolic language 
to draw attention to a whistleblower 
complaint authored by a top deputy 
prosecutor in Lindquist's office, Steven 
Merrival, president of Tacoma/Pierce County 
Bar Association. Mr. Merrival relayed 
accounts of black defendants charged with 
dramatically serious crimes, held on very 
high bails, tried at unusually high cost, 
and ultimately convicted of minor offenses. 
Another source, FUSE's Progressive Voters' 
Guide, which endorsed Lindquist's 
challenger<sup>1</sup>, concludes,<ul>We also have 
concerns about Lindquist's lack of progress 
toward reducing racial inequities in the 
local criminal justice system.</ul>

# Dishonest representation

Knowing full well I was in custody, and how 
I came into custody, Mr. Lindqist's 
prohibited, knowingly false, and alarming 
statements violated RPC 8.4. This Rule 
specifies _conduct_ entailing dishonesty and 
misrepresentation prejudicial to the 
administration of justice. If my ill-chosen seven words 
merited seven felonies and over a year in 
prison to Mr. Lindquist, your office must 
see his prohibited and inadequate 
disclosures as conduct deserving of 
consequences.

# Fictitious tension between RPC and elected prosecutor duties

Mr. Fogg claims elected prosecutors must be 
"given a degree of latitude to explain the 
nature and basis for" charges. Mr. Fogg 
characterizes the prohibited statements as 
"basic", and appears to argue that 
"latitude" implies a shift from the 
clearly-demarked limits of RPC 3.6 and RPC 
3.8 into "basic" ones that are, in fact, 
prohibited by the Rule. Mr. Fogg goes on to 
express concern for prosecutors state-wide. 
I am not aware of chronic violators of RPC 
3.6 and 3.8 outside Pierce County. In my own 
King County, the elected prosecutor is able 
to stay within the rules, primarily by 
witholding statements until the accused are 
convicted of crimes. This is one 
straightforward remedy to the fear Mr. Fogg 
expresses about "muzzled prosecutors".

Apparently convinced that I'm asking your 
office to enforce standards exceeding those 
clearly stated in RPC 3.6 and RPC 3.8(f), 
Mr. Fogg paints a dystopic outcome where 
"criminal defendants and prosecutors' 
political opponents" gain a "powerful new 
weapon with which to harass and impugn 
elected officials for simply doing their 
job." I'm seeking nothing more than 
application of RPC 3.6(b), rather than any 
change to it. Many of the "basic comments" 
Mr. Lindquist made to KIRO are also 
_prohibited_ comments, and I have offered 
alternative language that would clearly meet 
the safe harbor provisions of RPC 3.6(b).

While I'm struggling to envision the 
dystopic groundswell criminal defendants and 
political opponents might build against 
prosecutors upon strict enforcement of 
RPC 3.6, as a thought experiment, let's 
imagine a total replacement of RPC 3.6(b) 
with a prohibition of _all_ statements about 
the accused in custody. Does Mr. Fogg 
believe defendants would abandon 5th 
Amendment protections and instead speak 
publicly about the prosecutor or details of 
the arrest or any other topic? If so, these 
statements still can be used against the 
defendant in court by the prosecutor. Is it 
realistic to believe this would be the 
outcome of this change?

Mr. Fogg's dystopia includes unfairly 
empowered political opponents. Within this 
thought experiment of silence pertaining to 
the accused, a prosecutor can still speak 
freely after a trial concludes. And is it 
particularly unusual to envision state 
actors bound to silence while facing 
withering criticism by political opponents? 
Executives including the nation's President 
presumably face sensitive geopolitical 
matters where silence is needed even while 
political opponents make hay with 
speculation. For lawyers, including 
prosecutors, such near-silence is more than 
good judgement, but requisit. Furthermore, 
it is not the duty of your office to protect 
the political aspirations of lawyers who 
hold public office. Political opponents 
today can speculate and deride prosecutor 
handling of crimes under investigation. The 
strict limits of RPC 3.6 and 3.8 govern 
prosecutors in such a scenario, and do not 
govern their political opponents. Welcome to 
America!

# Confusion about duty

"Prosecutor Lindqist is a public official 
tasked with explaining to the public the 
work his office does."

I can envision many ways to meet this task, 
also described by Mr. Fogg as a duty, 
without violating RPC 3.6.

Mr. Fogg includes many citations to comments 
and cases related to RPC 3.6. None of these 
citations supersede the clear limitations 
specified in this Rule. Mr. Fogg seems to 
argue that some kind of tension exists 
between the "duty" of a prosecutor to inform 
the public and the obligations to the court 
under this Rule. He has created this 
tension. A dangerous suspect at large evokes 
a duty to protect, but an apprehended one 
evokes a duty to comply with RPC 3.6 and 
3.8, which intentionally limit the nature 
and scope of disclosures to a large 
audience.

Mr. Lindquist answers to the voters, but his 
first duty is to the court, and the court 
has defined communications by a prosecutor 
to a large audience about an accused who 
faces incarceration as strictly limited to 
specific informational disclosures precisely
limited in scope.
**Mr. Fogg confuses the 
elected prosecutor's legitimate duty to 
inform the public of danger with Mr. 
Lindquist's illegitimate public dissiminations about _non-dangers_ to public 
safety.**

Mr. Lindquist is 
confused about his duties as a lawyer and 
elected prosecutor.

# Censure is needed

Prosecutors throughout the nation 
successfully navigate the limitations placed 
on them by the Rules of Professional Conduct 
as established by the nation's highest 
courts. The limits are clear and I suggest 
they are easy for an educated person to 
follow. That Mr. Lindquist struggles with 
them should cause alarm. That Mr. Fogg 
further argues these limits exist in some 
kind of tension with the other "duties" and 
even political needs of an elected 
prosecutor causes deeper concern. He seems 
to present a thesis and rationale to defend 
a malfeasant pattern. People make errors. 
When they defend their errors with mistaken 
and misleading interpretations of the rules, 
a stronger response is needed.

Yours faithfully,

John Dempsey
