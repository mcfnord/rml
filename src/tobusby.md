Mr. Busby,

I've examined Mr. Fogg's letter of July xx,
2018, and must respond to its serious
deficiencies.

Perhaps in an effort to provide context, Mr. 
Fogg introduces details about my criminal 
trial in Superior Court of no relevance to 
the matter before you. On April 23rd, 2018, 
an article (Exhibit.x) in Tacoma News 
Tribune reported (**emphasis** is my own):<ul>In February 2015, 
Dempsey was charged with seven counts of 
felony harassment. The charges, dismissed 
eight months later, stemmed from a separate 
child custody case filed in Pierce County.

Dempsey was the petitioner; the matter was 
contentious. While the custody case was 
active, Dempsey posted a music video on his 
Facebook time line after a New Year's Eve 
party. The video played a violent punk-rock 
song that depicted men in suits being shot 
and stabbed. Dempsey added a comment: “This 
is my plan for superior court!”

The video provided the basis for the 
harassment charges. **Dempsey was acquitted 
on all counts. Superior Court Judge Ron 
Culpepper found that Dempsey didn’t intend 
to threaten any of the specific parties in 
the case, adding that prosecutors couldn’t 
prove otherwise.**</ul>This account is far 
clearer, fairer, and more accurate than Mr. 
Fogg's curated observations. Furthermore, 
all events following Mr. Lindquist's 
statements to KIRO, including details of my 
criminal trial, are irrelivant to this 
complaint. Finally, additional details 
reported by KIRO on its website ( Fogg's 
Exhibit B and underlying video from the 
terrestrial broadcast) are untrue, but 
derived from the charging document that 
quotes false reports made to police.

For whatever reason, Mr. Fogg's summary
of Mr. Lindquist's statements to the
press omits key details. Allow me to
present again this accurate summary
of the statements at issue in this complaint:


"Lindquist said investigators consider 
Dempsey a threat" is not information 
contained in the Declaration for 
Determination of Probable Cause. An accurate 
statement might be that _alleged victims_ 
consider Dempsey a threat. Investigators 
only declare their view that I communicated 
a threat to murder that they expand to four 
counts of the crime apparently based on the 
length of a list of people they assembled 
during an apparent investigation.

Mr. Fogg's claim that Judge Culpepper 
granted my motion to dismiss the 
Intimidating a Judge violation is close to 
my recollection, except the procedure 
eliminating the charge was a _pre-trial 
motion_, with no jury seated or trial 
actually started. This ruling, to my layman 
understanding, meant not that the crime 
didn't occur, but that it _could not have 
occurred_.

As well, Mr. Lindquist's claim that he 
"rounded me up" is not information protected 
by RPC 3.6, as it is not the fact of, time, 
or place of an arrest. Rather, it's a 
characterization of an arrest unspecific to 
any place and particular to vernacular 
typically applied to cattle.

Mr. Fogg claims<ul>RPC 3.6(a) must function 
consistently with the generally-recognized 
duties of an elected prosecutor, which 
include educating the public about crime in 
their community, about the nature and 
reasoning behind their office's charging 
decisions, and about the criminal justice 
system generally</ul> is misapplied here. 
Educating the public about crime fairly 
entails encouraging people to lock their 
doors at night, and take walks with a 
friend, and this specific matter is not 
about the criminal justice system generally. 
RPC 3.6 establishes clear rules information 
disclosures that "the nature and reasoning 
behind a charging decision" cannot exceed. I 
would have no objection had the prosecutor 
made statements about the nature and extent 
of his actions, which would be that he asked 
and I agreed to submit to arrest based on 4 
counts of communicating a threat to murder. 
Mr. Fogg's _Functions and Duties of the 
Prosecutor_ don't seek to exceed the clear 
limits placed on prosecutors by RPC 3.6.

Mr. Fogg has misinterpreted RPC 3.6 cmt. 1, 
which also does not advocate for statements 
outside the limits presented in the Rule. 
The fact, time, and place of the arrest and 
specification of charges are exactly the 
"information about legal proceedings 
themselves". cmt 1 might continue that the 
public has a "right to know about threats to 
its safety and measures aimed at assuring 
its security" but these tasks do not exceed 
the clear limitation of RPC 3.6, as once I 
was in custody, I could not be a threat. A 
genuine "measure aimed at assuring public 
security" might be increased night patrols 
during a crime wave, or other measure 
addressing an active safety threat.

Mr. Fogg argues that RPC 3.8(f) was not 
violated. It was. RPC 3.8(f) only adds 
limitations on prosecutors. The nature and 
extent of the prosecutor's action was, as 
previously stated, that he asked and I 
agreed to submit to arrest based on 4 counts 
of communicating a threat to murder. His 
claim that "investigators consider Dempsey a 
threat" and that "we rounded him up" are not 
protected under RPC 3.8(f).
No investigator declares they considered me 
a threat, and the folksy characterization of 
an arrestee roundup is misleading in ways 
explained previously, and outside the 
protections regarding the fact, time, and 
place of arrest.

RPC 3.8 cmt 5 does not justify these 
prohibited statements, and "the announcement 
of an indictment, for example, will 
necessarily have severe consequences for the 
accused." Such an announcement is limited to 
the fact, time, and place of arrest, and I 
agree such statements would have severe 
consequences for the person involved. Mr. 
Lindquist's statements that exceeeded the 
clear limits of RPC 3.6 (7)(iii) have additional severe 
consequences that are not tolerated by under 
RPC rules.

Mr. Fogg claims that the statement "we moved 
quick" is protected under RPC 3.6 (b)(3), 
but it is not. The Rule is clear, that a 
prosecutor can state that an investigation 
of a matter is in progress. This does not 
protect self-congratulatory statements or 
specific statements about an investigation's 
developments, only that an investigation is 
in progress. statement using RPC 3.6(b)(3)? 
A statement that an investigation is in 
progress is a precise, limited statement 
with no wiggle room for additional details 
or high-fives. It is not, as Mr. Fogg 
claims, "scheduling or result of any step in 
litigation" as "rounding up" is a 
(misleading) _characterization_ of an arrest 
(not a fact of, time, or place of arrest), 
and "we didn't wait" is not a report of a 
scheduled event or step of litigation. 
Rather, it's a subjective evaluation of 
PCPAO performance that seems to represent 
cheerleading and mislead the public about 
urgency that is unreflected in the actual 
timeline of events.

In summary so far, I dispute the safe harbor 
status of statements to the press that 
"investigators consider Dempsey a threat" so 
the PCPAO "move[d] quick" to "round him up" 
for reasons I've covered.


Mr. Lindquist's violations of Rules hinge on 
the improper character of his statements 
that he "knows... will be disseminated by 
means of public communication".

Mr. Fogg's list of these statements omitted 
one, so I re-state these statements here.

By applying Rule 3.6, I've prepared
this statement, which would not be
a Rule violation:

"Alleged 
victims consider Dempsey a threat, so at our 
request, he appeared at the courthouse at 
4pm and was arrested for 4 counts of Felony 
Harassment. This is an ongoing 
investigation."

this statmenet differs from those published
in key ways. Notice:

* Fidelity to charging document claims,
* absence of ambiguous claims about swiftness,
* absence of unspecific cattle-oriented imagery.

In the modified statement, note the fidelity 
to charging document claims, as well as the 
absence of ambiguity, subjective claims of 
swiftness, and cattle-oriented imagery.

Mr. Fogg appears confused regarding my 
waiving a jury trial due to Mr. Lindquist's 
prohibited statements. The fact is that I 
waived the jury at the appropriate time to 
do so, and with much effort. His Exhibit E 
documents the sequence of events. On 
September 22nd, I waived my right to a jury. 
On September 28, the next day of pre-trial 
acitivities, Judge Culpepper said he could 
not act as finder of fact because he is a 
friend of Judge Tollefson, the esteemed 
jurist named in my most serious charge. That 
afternoon, I argued successfully that the 
offense against Judge Tollefson _could not 
have occurred_, thus eliminating that 
charge. With it eliminated, I was able to 
waive my right to a jury a second and final 
time before the trial began.

I shudder when hearing Mr. Fogg seek a 
procedural dismissal because I successfully 
waived the jury, whose jury pool Mr. 
Lindquist poisoned with his widely 
distributed prohibited statements. Far from 
cause for your dismissal, that I felt it 
necessary to waive my jury trial at 
considerable effort and some risk of failure 
should give pause to any advocate of justice 
who values every defendant's right to a 
jury, a right often called the "gold 
standard of American criminal justice".

Mr. Fogg claims elected prosecutors must be 
"given a degree of latitude to explain the 
nature and basis for" charges. Mr. Fogg 
characterizes the prohibited statements as 
"basic", and appears to argue that 
"latitude" implies a shift from the 
clearly-demarked RPC 3.6 statements into 
those "basic" ones that are, in fact, 
prohibited by the Rule. Mr. Fogg goes on to 
express concern for prosecutors state-wide. 
I am not aware of chronic violators of RPC 
3.6 outside Pierce County. In my own King 
County, the elected prosecutor is able to 
stay within the rules, primarily by 
witholding statements until the accused are 
convicted of crimes. This is one 
straightforward remedy to the fear Mr. Fogg 
expresses about "muzzled prosecutors".

Apparently convinced that I'm asking the ODC 
to enforce standards exceeding those clearly 
stated in RPC 3.6(b), Mr. Fogg paints a 
dystopic outcome where "criminal defendants 
and prosecutors' political opponents" gain a 
"powerful new weapon with which to harass 
and impugn elected officials for simply 
doing their job." I'm seeking nothing more 
than application of RPC 3.6(b), rather than 
any change to it. Many of the "basic 
comments" Mr. Lindquist made to KIRO are 
also prohibited comments, and I have 
offered many basic statements that would 
clearly meet the safe harbor provisions of 
RPC 3.6(b). So I'm struggling to see 
the dystopia groundswell criminal defendants 
and political opponents might gain against 
prosecutors. But as a thought experiment, 
let's imagine a total replacement of RPC 
3.6(b) with a prohibition of _all_ statements 
about the accused. Does Mr. Fogg believe 
defendants would abandon 5th Amendment 
protections and instead speak publicly about 
the prosecutor or details of the arrest or 
any other topic? If so, these statements 
still can be used against the defendant in 
court by the prosecutor. Is it realistic to 
believe this would be the outcome of this 
change?

Mr. Fogg's dystopia includes political 
opponents. Within this thought experiment of 
silence pertaining to the accused, a 
prosecutor can speak freely after a trial 
concludes. And is it particularly unusual to 
envision the state or actors within it bound 
to silence while facing withering criticism 
by political opponents? Executives including 
the nation's President presumably face 
sensitive geopolitical matters where silence 
is a requisit even while political opponents 
make hay with speculation. For lawyers 
including prosecutors, such near-silence is 
more than good judgement, but requisit. 
Furhtermore, It is not the duty of the ODC 
to protect the political aspirations of 
lawyers who hold public office. Political 
opponents today can speculate and deride 
prosecutor handling of crimes under 
investigation and the alleged criminals 
involved. The strict limits of RPC 3.6 
govern prosecutors in such a scenario, and 
does not govern their political opponents. 
Welcome to America!

Mr. Fogg has located a website I maintain. I've 
included one document he mentions, a 
_Malfeasance Guide_, as Exhibit.x. Of x 
entries, one is a summary and HTML 
presentation of the letter you 
provided to Mr. Lindquist explaining your 
decision to recommend a public disciplinary 
hearing, now scheduled for December.

In Footnote 7, Mr. Fogg identifies an 
account and specific tweet on Twitter.com 
where I present a caricature of Mr. 
Lindquist, and lampoon and satarize him. The 
specific tweet Mr. Fogg quotes deserves 
additional exploration. Its language is 
hyperbolic, but its substance is a very 
serious criticism of his performance in 
office. FUSE voter's guide declaration of 
Buried the guy

I strongly dispute Mr. Fogg's claim that my 
motive is animosity toward "Lindquist, the 
PCPAO, and the justice system generally". My 
feelings are unrelated to the questions 
before the Bar. However, Mr. Fogg's 
misappraisal deserves additional response. 

 * I'm reminded of my upbringing in the 
house my parents built on 200th Street in 
Spanaway. My father's service revolver hung 
heavy in its holster in a message to this 
toddler that the forces of emnity are real, 
and serious, and that lawless hatred must 
not prevail. This year, a different Pierce 
County Sheriff was killed on duty on 200th 
Street by the same forces of lawlessness.
 * I'm reminded of my high school, where I 
served as President, elected on a platform, 
duty-bound to contribute my best judgement.
 * I'm reminded of Sgt. Emily Rose Murphy, 
USMC, an eight year Marine veteran who spoke 
plainly about me raising her child. (Exhibit 
x) I think of her drive and committment to 
defend liberty. When I was caring for her in 
hospice, we said often to each other, 
"Semper Fi, do or die." _Semper fidelis_ 
means always faithful. Honesty is a 
requirement for faithfulness.
 * I'm reminded of my career in technical 
writing in the software industry. where good 
words convey a helpful understanding, while 
bad words obscure key facts, and lead to 
engineering failures and huge expenses. 

It's 
as if my life has made me an enemy of the 
injustice of falsehoods. I'm driven to use 
words to seek the truth, and use them to 
lead against the forces of misinformation.

"Prosecutor Lindqist is a public official 
tasked with explaining to the public the 
work his office does."

I can envision many ways to meet this task, 
described here as a duty, without violating 
RPC 3.6.

Mr. Fogg includes many citations to comments 
and cases related to RPC 3.6. None of these 
citations supersede the clear limitations 
specified in this Rule. Mr. Fogg
seems to argue that 
some kind of tension exists between the 
"duty" of a prosecutor to inform the public 
and the obligations to the court under this 
Rule, but he has created this 
tension. An active threat to safety evokes 
duty to protect, but an apprehended one does 
not.

Mr. Fogg disputes the plain meaning of _we 
rounded him up_. Most definitions pertain to 
cattle, much the way I rounded up milk cows 
from the pastures as a young man along 
Spanaway's 200th street. Do you think it's 
appropriate to choose words most commonly 
associated with cattle? Does that phrase 
fairly reflect the facts of my choices on 
that Friday to immediately submit to the 
custody of the state, at my own expense and 
under my own power? The definitions 
pertaining to humans are worse, suggesting 
force. Even sending a car would provide a 
stronger defense of this lanaugage. None of 
that is true. Would you deem it fair to 
characterize your own voluntary and 
immediate submission to state custody to be 
'gettin rouned up'? Shouldn't you shake your 
hat as you talk that way? And aren't you 
clearly implying a wrastle, lasso, or cattle 
drive to do it? Yee-haw Justice?

As these words are not a duty of the 
prosecutor, but purely discressionary, why 
not choose clear words, and ones that don't 
imply I'm cattle, or that vague, rowdy 
effort was involved? And if Mr. Lindquist 
knows statements to the press through video 
recordings are hard for him, why not just 
provide a written statement to the press?

Injustice sometimes has a way of unleashing 
extra-ordinary resistence. While his 
statements to the press are the only issue 
of importance here, Mr. Lindquist had an 
absolute right to subject me to a trial, but 
I dispute the wisdom of his choice to do so.

Let's summarize: Informing the public during 
a public danger is the duty of the 
Prosecutor. Informing the public during any 
non-danger is a preference of the 
Prosecutor. Discressionary words should meet 
the highest scrutiny under 3.6 and 3.8, and 
these do not.

Mr. Fogg stated in the press:
"we gotta do this, there's no basis, so just 
dismiss" and your office didn't dismiss.
What's different here that we should believe
Mr. Fogg making the same argument this time?

My critique is now strongly 
paralleled in his challenger's publications.
Does Mr. Fogg cast aspersions on the motives
of the challenger for publishing their similar
views?

When essays I write 
routinely reach hundreds, it may be because I'm 
speaking truth to power, and revealing and 
clarifying the truths of Mr. Lindquist's career in 
elected office. That's a contribution to 
democracy, not malevolence. Frankly I don't find 
malevolence interesting or healthy, but I do 
believe in cleaning up bad governance. When you 
see something, say something.

Since Mr. Fogg took so much time to discuss the 
charges of his client's failed prosecution, I 
suggest that seven words may not reliably convey 
intent, and much time could have been saved 
through an inquiry about intent prior to charging. 
This view gained substantial strength after 
_Alonis v. U.S.A,_ and I considered Mr. 
Lindquist's choice to proceed after that SCOTUS 
ruling as either malevolance or avoidance of embarassment on 
his part. Neither should inform decisions to go to 
trial, and both are contrary to
the Prosecutor's Duty to justice in RPC 3.8.
yet he did. The prosecutor has an 
obligation to justice, including adjustment as 
guidance from the Supreme Court emerges.

My step-mother has reported a concerning 
account of Mr. Lindquist touching her 
inappropriately, and has made it clear that 
she will scream if he does so again. She 
paid my substantial bail, and has a right to 
her feelings. No one should discount her 
words based on her experience.

Mr. Fogg's letter seeks to disparage me, and 
re-litigate the case Mr. Lindquist already lost.

I suspect one reason we have RPC 3.6 and 3.8 rules 
governing public statements by prosecutors is 
because it's quite possible for a dishonest 
complainant to temporarily mislead them. The 
details of their arrest are the limit placed by 
the court, incredibly factual and basic details, 
which I would not have cause to object to. They 
are presented by the court to strongly restrict, 
not empower prosecutors when speaking to the press.

I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Lindquist's 
predicessor, Gerald Horne. He said the accused are 
considered innocent until convicted in a court of 
law, and that would be his only statement to the 
press. In a public Q&A, challenger Mary Robnett 
cited these RPC rules as mandating "silence" about 
the accused, with the only exception being people 
on the run and posing a genuine public safety 
danger.

In closing before Judge Lanaise, Lindquist's
counsel explained that he answers to the
voters. 

You can also 
review a similar guide provided by the 
ballot challenger, an eminently qualified 
lawyer familiar with the facts. 
http://factsaboutmark I consider the 
similarities between these sites as a 
testimony to the relevance and accuracy of 
my appraisals.

I believe democratic mechanisms including 
ballots are among the few protections we 
have against dishonest elected officials and 
the dark, self-serving forces they can 
inflict onto the citizenry.

Additionally, consider the summary of
FUSE's Progressive Voters' Guide, which
endorses Lindquist's challenger, and concludes,

<ul>We also have concerns about Lindquist's lack 
of progress toward reducing racial inequities in 
the local criminal justice system.</ul>

It's one thing to use a racial epitat in a 
satirical tweet. It's another to prosecute crime 
in America without a solid focus on how race (and 
class, and disability) influences outcomes. Mr. 
Fogg finds my single word tittilating. I find the 
voter's guide's concern quite grave.

Lindquist made more misleading statements more 
recently, in responses to both TNT and KIRO 
reporters, by describing me as a person his office 
prosecuted. (Exhibit.x) It's more accurate to say 
I'm a person his office prosecuted 
_unsuccessfully_.. Is it so hard to be both 
accurate and fair in widely distributed statements 
to the press? 

I waived my jury trial due to Mr. Lindquist's 
public statements, denying me of my right to a 
jury. - same text as bar complaint?

I could not afford 
further delay, because I could not resolve 
the custody trial until the criminal trial 
was resolved. But when the judge eliminated 
the most serious charge pertaining to his 
peer in response to a _pre-trail_ motion, I 
was then able again to choose a bench trial 
without further delay. A speedy trial is 
another right, and unlike the prosecutor, 
the county's treasury is not available to 
me. The facts show my concerted effort to 
avoid a jury trial, precisely because Mr. 
Lindquist spoke inapporiately and falsely to 
an unusually large audience about me.

Mr. Fogg closes with the same claim, that 
duty obligates these communications. Duty 
obligates him to share none of these, and 
prohibits some. Mr. Lindquist answers to the 
voters, but his first duty is to the court, 
and the court has defined communications by 
a prosecutor to a large audience about an 
accused who faces incarceration as precisely 
limited to specific informational statements 
that it limits in scope. **Mr. Fogg 
confuses the elected prosecutor's legitimate 
duty to inform the public of danger with Mr. 
Lindquist's illegitimate public 
dissiminations about _non-dangers_ to public 
safety.** His duty to the court clearly 
obligates him to provide more concision and 
precision when choosing to address the 
press.  I see no public safety purpose for 
his statements about me to KIRO, as I was in 
custody. His duty specifies his allowed 
communications clearly. 
When citizens face present 
danger, his duty is to protect them with 
information. When an accused is in custody, 
his duty is to abide by RPC 3.6 in every 
disclosure, and possibly say nothing at all. 
He answers to the voters but his duty is
to the court.
Mr. Lindquist is confused about his duties 
as a lawyer and elected prosecutor.

Being a lawyer sounds like a hard job. Being 
a lawyer who is an elected official 
appearing on regionally broadcast television 
also sounds hard. This is because the rules 
are strict, and that's because the strict 
rules are established by the state's Supreme 
Court to defend the cause of justice. 
Lawyers who cannot meet this high, important 
standard cannot be lawyers safely in 
Washington State.

Prosecutors throughout the nation 
successfully navigate the limitations placed 
on them by the Rules of Professional Conduct 
as established by the nation's highest 
courts. The limits are clear and I suggest 
they are easy for an educated person to 
follow. That Mr. Lindquist struggles with 
them should cause alarm. That Mr. Fogg 
further argues these limits exist in some 
kind of tension with the other "duties" and 
needs of a prosecutor causes deeper concern. 
He seems to present a thesis 
and rationale to defend a malfeasant 
pattern. People make errors. When they 
defend their errors with mistaken and 
misleading interpretations of the rules, 
a clear response is needed. There is no 
place in a just nation for this sort of 
disturbing rhetoric.
