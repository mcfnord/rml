In response:

Mr. Fogg summarizes events and claims reported to the PCPAO that
arrived in their probable cause declaration. Some of these are
false claims, for example, there were no taunting videos from me,
regardless of what Ms. Young's clients claimed.

I was not charged with a count of Intimidating 
a Judge and 3 counts of Felony Harassment. I was charged on Feb 23rd
with 4 counts of Felony Harassment, and Judge Tollefson was not
any count at that time. The four alleged victims on Feb 23rd were:
D & M Murphy, and H. Young and C. Hansen.

Mr. Fogg's summary of his Exhibit B is incomplete, as he omits
the attributed reporting that "Lindquist says investigators consider
x a threat." 

Mr. Fogg's summary of Exhibit C is confused about which victims
were added in the summer, but it's accurate to say
that August 20th concluded with 7 felony charges against me.

Mr. Fogg's claim that Judge Culpepper granted my motion to dismiss
the Intimidating a Judge violation is close to my recollection,
except the procedure eliminating the charge was a _pre-trial motion_,
with no jury seated or trial actually started. This ruling, to my
layman understanding, meant not that the crime didn't occur, but
that it _could not have occurred_.

Mr. Fogg's claim that on October 7th, 2015, Judge Culpepper
acquitted me based<ul>largely on the fact that most of the alleged
victims were not Facebook "friends" with Mr. Dempsey and therefore
did not receive his alleged threat</ul>is incorrect. While his Exhibit D
makes note of these details, Facebook friend connections are not
mentioned in Judge Culpepper's oral verdict, nor did the 
ability of any alleged victim to see my friend-protected post play
any role in Judge Culpepper's decision, because access to a threat
is not a factor or defense in Washington's direct threat (real threat?)
case law.
Instead, Judge Culpepper
ruled that I did not have the motive to communicate a threat,
a critical component of all felonies. Judge Culpepper's oral
verdict is my Exibit.x.

"Lindquist said investigators consider Dempsey a threat" is not information 
contained in the Declaration for Determination of Probable Cause. An 
accurate statement would be that _alleged victims_ consider Dempsey a 
threat. Investigators only conclude their view that I communicated a threat 
to murder that they expand to four counts of the crime apparently based on 
the length of a list of people they assembled during an apparent 
investigation. 

As well, Mr. Lindquist's claim that he "rounded me up" is not information
protected by RPC 3.6, as it is not the fact of, time, or
place of an arrest. Rather, it's a characterization of an arrest
unspecific to any place and particular to vernacular typically
applied to cattle. 

Mr. Fogg claims<ul>RPC 3.6(a) must function consistently with the 
generally-recognized duties of an elected prosecutor, which include 
educating the public about crime in their community, about the nature and 
reasoning behind their office's charging decisions, and about the criminal 
justice system generally</ul> is misapplied here. Educating the public about 
crime fairly entails encouraging people to lock their car doors at night, 
and take walks with a friend, and this specific matter is not about the 
criminal justice system generally. RPC 3.6 establishes clear rules 
information disclosures that "the nature and reasoning behind a charging 
decision" cannot exceed. I would have no objection had the prosecutor
made statements about the nature and extent of his actions, which
would be that he asked and I agreed to submit to arrest based on 4 counts of
communicating a threat to murder. Mr. Fogg's
_Functions and Duties of the Prosecutor_ don't seek to exceed the
clear limits placed on prosecutors by RPC 3.6.

Mr. Fogg has misinterpreted RPC 3.6 cmt. 1, which also does not
advocate for statements outside the limits presented in the Rule.
The fact, time, and place of the arrest and specification of
charges are exactly the "information about legal proceedings themselves".
cmt 1 might continue that the public has a "right to know about threats
to its safety and measures aimed at assuring its security" but these
tasks do not exceed the clear limitation of RPC 3.6, as once I was
in custody, I could not be a threat. A genuine "measure aimed at
assuring public security" might be increased night patrols during
a crime wave, or other measure addressing an active safety threat.

Mr. Fogg argues that RPC 3.8(f) was not violated. It was. 
RPC 3.8(f) only adds limitations on prosecutors. The nature and
extent of the prosecutor's action was, as previously stated,
that he asked and I agreed to submit to arrest based on 4 counts of
communicating a threat to murder. His claim that "investigators consider
Dempsey a threat" and that "we rounded him up" are not protected under
RPC 3.8(f), as they do not serve a legitimate law enforcement purpose.
No investigator declares they considered me a threat, and the folksy
characterization of an arrestee roundup is misleading in ways
explained previously, and outside the protections regarding the fact, time,
and place of arrest.

RPC 3.8 cmt 5 does not justify these prohibited statements, and
"the announcement of an indictment, for example, will necessarily
have severe consequences for the accused." Such an announcement is limited
to the fact, time, and place of arrest, and I agree such statements
would have severe consequences for the person involved. Mr. Lindquist's
statements that exceeeded the clear limits of RPC 3.6 (7)(iii) 
have severe consequences that are not tolerated by under RPC rules.

So I disagree with Mr. Fogg's view that RPC 3.6 and RPC 3.8 were not
violated.

Mr. Fogg claims that the statement "we moved quick" is protected
under RPC 3.6 (b)(3), but it is not. The Rule is clear, that a prosecutor
can state that an investigation of a matter is in progress. This does
not protect self-congratulatory statements or specific statements
about an investigation's developments, only that an investigation is
in progress. Could you imagine another prosecutor, Robert Mueller,
saying, "We rounded up Manifort today. We wanted to move quick" and
then defending his public statement using RPC 3.6(b)(3)? A statement
that an investigation is in progress is a precise, limited statement 
with no wiggle room provided for additional details or high-fives.
It is not, as Mr. Fogg claims, "scheduling or result of any step in
litigation" as "rounding up" is a (misleading) _characterization_ of an 
arrest (not a fact of, time, or place of arrest), and "we didn't wait"
is not a report of a scheduled event or step of litigation. Rather,
it's a subjective evaluation of PCPAO performance that seems to
represent cheerleading and mislead the public about urgency
unreflected in the actual timeline.

In summary so far, I dispute the safe harbor status
of statements to the press that 
"investigators consider Dempsey a threat" so the PCPAO 
"move[d] quick" to "round him up" for reasons I've covered.

Compare to a protected statement: "Alleged victims consider
Dempsey a threat, so at our request, he appeared at the courthouse
at 4pm and was arrested for 4 counts of Felony Harassment. This is an
ongoing investigation."

In the modified statement, note the absence of ambiguity, subjective
claims of swiftness, and cattle-oriented imagery.

Mr. Fogg claims I'm lying regarding waiving a jury trial due to Mr. 
Lindquist's prohibited statements. His claim is insulting. The fact is that 
I waived the jury at the appropriate time to do so, and with much effort.
His Exhibit E makes the sequence of events clear:

On September 22nd, I waived my right to a jury.
On September 28, the next day of trial acitivities, Judge Culpepper
said he could not act as finder of fact because he is a friend of 
Judge Tollefson. That afternoon, I argued successfully that the
offense against Judge TOllefson _could not have occurred_. With
the charge eliminated, I was able to waive my right to a jury a second
and final time before the trial began.

Mr. Fogg seems to have reversed my motives in his determination of 
dishonesty. How would I waive a jury trial "because of concern about bias 
_from the assigned trial judge_"? The trial judge's concern about his own 
bias forced me to withdraw my waiver until I was able to eliminate the cause 
of the judge's bias concern, and waive again. Where's the lie? I was not in 
a position to schedule a trial in another court, but strenuously resisted a 
jury trial for the exact reasons stated. In his footnote 6, Mr. Fogg
notes the facts correctly, and now I've noted the motives that led to
those facts. Mr. Busby, do you see evidence of a lie here?

Mr. Fogg claims "very strong policy reasons why the.... Grievance should be 
dismissed outright." I've disputed his claim that RPC 3.6(b) protects the 
statements. He's also claiming my successful effort to waive the jury trial 
adds up to "none of the alleged prejudice" actually materializing. What 
materialized was "the poisoning of the well" where it became hard to find a 
jury I know to be unexposed to the prohibited public statements. Far from 
cause for dismissal, that I felt it necessary to waive my jury trial at 
considerable effort and some risk of failure should give pause to any 
advocate of justice who values what Justice Scalia called the "gold standard 
of American justice".

Mr. Fogg claims elected prosecutors must be "given a degree of latitude to 
explain the nature and basis for" charges. Mr. Fogg characterizes the 
prohibited statements as "basic", and appears to argue that "latitude" 
implies a shift from the clearly-demarked RPC 3.6 statements into those 
"basic" ones that are, in fact, prohibited by the Rule. Mr. Fogg goes on to 
express concern for prosecutors state-wide. I am not aware of chronic 
violators of RPC 3.6 outside Pierce County. In my own King County, the 
elected prosecutor is able to stay within the rules, primarily by witholding 
statements until the accused are convicted of crimes. This is one 
straightforward remedy to the fear Mr. Fogg expresses about "muzzled 
prosecutors". 

Apparently convinced that I'm asking the ODC to enforce standards 
exceeding those clearly stated in RPC 3.6(b), Mr. Fogg paints a dystopic 
outcome where "criminal defendants and prosecutors' political opponents" 
gain a "powerful new weapon with which to harass and impugn elected 
officials for simply doing their job." I'm seeking nothing more than
application of RPC 3.6(b), rather than any change to it. 
Many of the "basic comments" Mr. Lindquist made to KIRO are also
prohibited statements, and I have offered many basic statements
that would clearly meet the safe harbor provisions of RPC 3.6(b).
So I'm struggling to envision the dystopia groundswell criminal defendants 
and political opponents might gain against prosecutors. But as a thought
experiment, let's
imagine a total replacement of RPC 3.6(b) with a prohibition of all
statements about the accused. Does Mr. Fogg believe defendants would
abandon 5th Amendment protections and instead speak publicly about
the prosecutor or details of the arrest or any other topic? If so,
these statements still can be used against the defendant in court by
the prosecutor. Is it realistic to believe this would be the outcome
of this change? 

Mr. Fogg's dystopia includes political opponents. Within this thought 
experiment of silence pertaining to the accused, a prosecutor can speak 
freely after a trial concludes. Is it particularly unusual to envision the 
state or actors within it bound to silence while facing withering criticism 
by political opponents? Executives including the nation's President 
presumably face sensitive geopolitical matters where silence is a requisit 
even while political opponents make hay with speculation. It is not the duty 
of the ODC to protect the political aspirations of lawyers who hold public 
office.

Mr. Fogg has located a website I maintain and publish on the public
internet. I've included one document he mentions, a _Malfeasance Guide_,
as Exhibit.x. Of x entries documenting malfeasance by Mr. Lindquist,
one is a summary and HTML presentation of the letter you, Mr. Busby,
provided to Mr. Lindquist announcing your decision to recommend a public
disciplinary hearing, now scheduled for December. I leave it as an exercise
to the reader to determine whether it's fair to call the prohibited
statements Mr. Lindquist made on _Nancy Grace_ as malfeasance.

In Footnote 7, Mr. Fogg identifies an account and specific tweet on 
Twitter.com where I present a caricature of Mr. Lindquist, and lampoon
and satarize him. The specific tweet Mr. Fogg quotes deserves
additional exploration, as its language is hyperbolic, but its substance
is a very serious criticism of his performance in office.
FUSE voter's guide
declaration of Buried the guy

In fact, I am actively involved in the campaign to remove Mr. Lindquist.
However, I strongly dispute Mr. Fogg's claim that my motive is animosity
toward "Lindquist, the PCPAO, and the justice system generally". This is
probably Mr. Fogg's most offensive claim.

"Prosecutor Lindqist is a public official tasked with explaining to the 
public the work his office does."

I can envision many ways to meet this task, described here as a duty,
without violating RPC 3.6.

Being a lawyer sounds like a hard job. Being a lawyer who is an elected 
official appearing on regionally broadcast television also sounds hard. This 
is because the rules are strict, and that's because the strict rules are 
established by the state's Supreme Court to defend the cause of justice. 
Lawyers who cannot meet this high, important standard cannot be lawyers 
safely in Washington State. 


considering for a moment a prohibition 
of 
statements about the merely 
accused
But 
it's hard to comprehend
why a criminal defendant would waive his 5th Amendment right to silence
to instead get vocal. What does this dystopia look like ?The prosecutor's 
proper response 
would be
to collect these statements and present them to the court.






The ethics of the N-word are a useful exercise. 
Satirical use by a citizen in a political campaign 
is irrelivant to this complaint. But misuse in 
PowerPoint in front of a jury can force a 
re-trial, as Mr. Lindquist knows.

Mr. Fogg disputes the plain meaning of _we rounded 
him up_. Most definitions pertain to cattle, much 
the way I rounded up milk cows from the pastures 
as a young man on a 3-wheeler in the pastures 
along Spanaway's 200th street. Do you think it's 
appropriate to choose words most commonly 
associated with cattle? Does that phrase fairly 
reflect the facts of my choices on that Friday to 
immediately submit to the custody of the state,
at my own expense and under my own power?
The definitions pertaining to humans are worse, 
suggesting force. Even sending a car would provide 
a stronger defense of this lanaugage. None of that 
is true. Would you deem it fair to characterize 
your own voluntary and immediate submission to 
state custody to be 'gettin rouned up'? Shouldn't 
you shake your hat as you talk that way? And 
aren't you clearly implying a wrastle, lasso, or 
cattle drive to do it? Yee-haw Justice?

As these words are not a duty of the prosecutor, 
but purely discressionary, why not choose clear 
words, and ones that don't imply I'm cattle, or 
that effort was involved?

I do hold the view that I've been mistreated by 
Mr. Lindquist, precisely for the reasons I've 
explained, and for additional reasons, which 
aren't subject of this complaint. Injustice 
sometimes has a way of unleashing extra-ordinary 
resistence. I don't want anyone to experience 
similar treatment, and solumnly embrace the task 
of righting a wrong I myself have experienced, and 
have now also documented as the experience of many 
like me.

Mr. Fogg has spent some time looking around my web 
publications and offering his summaries to you. 
He didn't mention that your own letter to
Lindquist regarding his statements on _Nancy Grace_
appears on my website in an easy-to-read format.

http://ReplaceMarkLindquist.info/grace.html

The full text of an independent invesgitation
also appears on on my website, also in easy-to-read
format:

http://ReplaceMarkLindquist.info/busto.html

And so what if I've written about my experiences 
and shared my conclusions. I don't consider any of 
these publications to be germane to this complaint.

Let's summarize: Informing the public during a 
public danger is the duty of the Prosecutor. 
Informing the public during any non-danger is a 
preference of the Prosecutor. Discressionary words 
should meet the highest scrutiny under 3.6 and 
3.8, and these do not.

As one among many partisans in this cause, I can 
report that I'm not the most motivated or 
passionate for the cause. My mother, now 80, 
collected 150 signatures in the recall effort Mr. 
Fogg called a failure.

Mr. Fogg stated in the press:
"we gotta do this, there's no basis, so just 
dismiss" and your office didn't dismiss.
What's different here that we should believe
Mr. Fogg making the same argument this time?

I take umbrage at the claim that I'm driven by 
emnity toward Mr. Lindquist, rather than a thirst 
for just treatment for all. That low blow is 
personal for me. It takes me back to my upbringing 
in the house my parents built on 200th Street in 
Spanaway. My father's service revolver hung from 
his holster in a message to this toddler that the 
forces of emnity are real, and serious, and that 
lawless hatred must not prevail. This year, a 
different Pierce County Sheriff was killed on duty 
on 200th Street by the forces of lawlessness. And 
it reminds me of my high school, where I served as 
President, elected on a platform, duty-bound to 
contribute my best judgement. And it makes me 
remember Sgt. Emily Rose Murphy, USMC, an eight 
year Marine veteran who spoke plainly about me 
raising her child. Her plain words (Exhibit x) 
were lost in a deluge of confusion, including some 
from the unwise involvement of criminal charges in 
a civil dispute. I think of her drive and 
committment to defend liberty. When I was caring 
for her in hospice, we said often to each other, 
"Semper Fi, do or die." Semper fidelis means 
always faithful. Honesty is a requirement for 
faithfulness. And it reminds me of my career in 
technical writing in the software industry. where 
good words convey truth, while bad words convey 
falsehoods, and lead to engineering failures and 
huge expenses. It's as if my life has made me an 
enemy of the injustice of falsehoods. I'm driven 
to use words to seek the truth, and use them to 
lead against the forces of misinformation.

While Mr. Fogg is critical of my public words, 
strangers have thanked me for my willingness to 
defend democratic principles from all enemies. 
Many have thanked me for speaking truth to power, 
and standing up for transparency when it was under 
attack by Lindquist's own staff, at his command.. 
Exhibit.x In contrast, Mr. LIndquist has struggled 
to comply with laws based on these democratic 
prinicples. Exhibit.Lanaise

Weeks ago an essay I prepared about Mr. 
Lindquist's use of words was widely shared. 
Exhibit.x Clearly I have a critique about his
fitness for office  
that extends beyond his choices about me in front 
of KIRO reporters. My critique is now strongly 
paralleled in his challenger's publications.
Does Mr. Fogg cast aspersions on the motives
of the challenger for publishing their similar
views?

When essays I write 
routinely reach hundreds, it may be because I'm 
speaking truth to power, and revealing and 
clarifying the truths of Mr. Lindquist's career in 
elected office. That's a contribution to 
democracy, not malevolence. Frankly I don't find 
malevolence interesting or healthy, but I do 
believe in cleaning up bad governance. When you 
see something, say something.

Since Mr. Fogg took so much time to discuss the 
charges of his client's failed prosecution, I 
suggest that seven words may not reliably convey 
intent, and much time could have been saved 
through an inquiry about intent prior to charging. 
This view gained substantial strength after 
_Alonis v. U.S.A,_ and I considered Mr. 
Lindquist's choice to proceed after that SCOTUS 
ruling as either malevolance or embarassment on 
his part. Neither should inform decisions to go to 
trial, yet he did. The prosecutor has an 
obligation to justice, including adjustment as 
guidance from the Supreme Court emerges.

Finally, I find Mr. Fogg's summary of the not 
guilty judgement to be lacking. He did not include 
the judge's oral remarks, Exhibit.x. which do not 
center on whether I was Facebook friends, a rather 
incidental detail that could be misconstrued as 
some sort of technicality. I was not acquitted on 
a technicality. I was acquitted because I never 
intended to threaten anyone, a critical part of 
all felony law.

I hope you see how my own experience has brought 
me to the hopeful act of political activism. I 
don't have a malevolant view that Mr. Lindquist 
himself is a bad guy. He's a man from an 
exceptional family who I believe has revealed 
clearly that he is not qualified to be a 
prosecutor.

My step-mother has reported a concerning account 
of Mr. Lindquist touching her inappropriately, and 
has made it clear that she will scream if he does 
so again. She paid my substantial bail, and has a 
right to her feelings. Would you discount her 
words based on her experience?

It's worth note that the matter Mr. Fogg calls _a 
failed recall effort_ satisfied the constitutional
test of review by a judge, who determined
that the effort met scrutiny. It's a high standard!

Mr. Busby,

Mr. Fogg's letter seeks to disparage me, and 
re-litigate the case Mr. Lindquist already lost.

Mr. Fogg repeats the false claim that I directed 
taunts toward the clients of Heather Young. There 
are no taunts. The source of these false claims is 
a single report from Darin Murphy. (Exhibit 1) His 
claims in both a deposition (Exhibit 2) and trial 
testimony (Exhibit 3) were disturbingly dishonest.
Should Mr. Fogg be repeating them as truth?

I suspect one reason we have RPC 3.6 and 3.8 rules 
governing public statements by prosecutors is 
because it's quite possible for a dishonest 
complainant to temporarily mislead them. The 
details of their arrest are the limit placed by 
the court, incredibly factual and basic details, 
which I would not have cause to object to. They 
are presented by the court to strongly restrict, 
not empower prosecutors when speaking to the press.

This is because prosecutors are tasked with 
speaking to the court, not the public.

The OPC and Mr. Lindquist should examine the 
substantial difference between public statements 
about convictions and those about unproven 
charges.

I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Lindquist's 
predicessor, Gerald Horne. He said the accused are 
considered innocent until convicted in a court of 
law, and that would be his only statement to the 
press. In a public Q&A, challenger Mary Robnett 
cited these RPC rules as mandating "silence" about 
the accused, with the only exception being people 
on the run and posing a genuine public safety 
danger.

An independent investigator explained about
Mr. Lindquist's relationship with the media:

xxx quote

Mr. Fogg seeks to mislead you with an unbalanced 
summary of work I've done as a citizen in the 
political arena.

In closing before Judge Lanaise, Lindquist's
counsel explained that he answers to the
voters. I have sought to inform voters,
and have succeeded, to wit, the front-page
TNT article explained 

Judge Lanaise determined that Mr. Lindquist 
committed malfeasance. Your own office determined 
that he should face a public hearing, and could be 
suspended from from the bar. My own public records 
request revealed behavior by his staff deemed 
front-page news by the independent press. In my 
view, an ongoing pattern of malfeasance merits a 
_Malfeasance Guide_, because it's hard to keep 
track of all the scandals. You can review mine 
here. http://piercejustice.info You can also 
review a similar guide provided by the ballot 
challenger, an eminently qualified lawyer familiar 
with the facts. http://factsaboutmark
I consider the similarities between these
sites as a testimony to the relevance and
accuracy of my appraisals.

I believe democratic mechanisms including ballots 
are among the few protections we have against 
dishonest elected officials and the dark, 
self-serving forces they can inflict onto the 
citizenry.

Regarding his footnote citing a tweet,
please consider the declaration of Bertha.

Additionally, consider the summary of
FUSE's Progressive Voters' Guide, which
endorses Lindquist's challenger, and concludes,

<ul>We also have concerns about Lindquist's lack 
of progress toward reducing racial inequities in 
the local criminal justice system.</ul>

It's one thing to use a racial epitat in a 
satirical tweet. It's another to prosecute crime 
in America without a solid focus on how race (and 
class, and disability) influences outcomes. Mr. 
Fogg finds my single word tittilating. I find the 
voter's guide's concern quite grave.

While I'm new to this kind of activism, I have 
worked incredibly hard to amplify and democratize 
conclusions of neutral and respected sources, 
including your own findings about the ill-advised 
Nancy Grace appearance. I have employed persuasive 
techniques including satire, but never 
deception. I have also documented the persuasion 
techniques Mr. Lidnquist has developed that 
circumvent the legitimate press (Exhibit x). Is 
this what Mr. Fogg calls "informing the public" ? 
I call this branding.

Lindquist made more misleading statements more 
recently, in responses to both TNT and KIRO 
reporters, by describing me as a person his office 
prosecuted. (Exhibit.x) It's more accurate to say 
I'm a person his office prosecuted 
_unsuccessfully_.. Is it so hard to be both 
accurate and fair in widely distributed statements 
to the press? Are we doomed to the wilful
shaving down of truths until they're misleading?
Rounded me up? Prosecuted me? His training
in words and employment of a spokesman
has led me to believe his prevarications
are wilful.

But all these facts are neither here nor there, 
because I'm not facing prosecution. Why Mr. Fogg 
focuses on the failed prosecution is unclear to 
me. Let's get to the facts that matter in the 
matter before you: His statements to the press 
about the accused.

1. I waived my jury trial due to Mr. Lindquist's 
public statements, denying me of my right to a 
jury.

Mr. Fogg correctly documents the sequence of 
events that resulted in a bench (non-jury) trial. 
My original request to waive the jury had to be 
withdrawn because the judge shared an office with 
the other judge I stood accused of threatening to 
murder. Judge Culpepper explained that the only 
way to honor my request was to get a different 
judge, or accept a jury. I could not afford 
further delay, because I could not resolve the 
custody trial until the criminal trial was 
resolved. But when the judge eliminated the most 
serious charge pertaining to his peer in response 
to a _pre-trail_ motion, I was then able again to 
choose a bench trial without further delay. A 
speedy trial is another right, and unlike the 
prosecutor, the county's treasury is not available 
to me. The facts show my concerted effort to avoid 
a jury trial, precisely because Mr. Lindquist 
spoke inapporiately and falsely to an unusually 
large audience about me.
