Re: ODC File No. 18-00978 — Preliminary Response to Grievance by John
Dempsey against Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist

Dear Mr. Busby:

Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist has asked me to respond to your June 12, 2018
letter regarding the above-referenced grievance tiled by John Dempsey, who was charged and tried

with seven counts of Felony Harassment by the Pierce County Prosecutor’s Office (“PCPAO”) in
2015. Mr. Dempsey‘s one-paragraph Grievance alleges that Prosecutor Lindquist violated the
Rules of Professional Conduct “in verbal statements broadcast on KIRO Evening News and as cited

in the article that accompanies the broadcast published by KIRO on its website.”

The Grievance is woefully bereft of details. Rather than include a copy of the KIRO
broadcast or article, Mr. Dempsey references an April 24 “paper submission" to ODC, which
Prosecutor Lindquist has not received, and an online webpage Mr. Dempsey apparently maintains,l
which contains a number of posts critical of the PCPAO and Prosecutor Lindquist personally. One
such post is titled “Dempsey bar complaint“ and reflects a purported April 20, 2018 communication

to the WSBA, asserting that Prosecutor Lindquist violated RPCs 3.6, and RPC 3.3.2 This
preliminary response assumes that Mr. Dempsey’s April 20, 2018 post contains the substance of
the Grievance to which ODC has asked Prosecutor Lindquist to respond.

As indicated in court records from the PCPAO‘s prosecution of Mr. Dempsey} the charges
against Mr. Dempsey were based on an internet post by Mr. Dempsey that was in turn referred to
the Tacoma Police by Heather Young, a Tacoma-area attorney who was representing parties
adverse to Mr. Dempsey in a highly contentious child custody case. See Exhibit A (Information
and Declaration for Determination of Probable Cause). Specifically, on January 12, 2015, Ms.
Young notified the Tacoma Police that one of her clients, Donna Mairs, who had custody of the
minor that was the subject of the child custody dispute, had seen a Facebook post by Mr. Dempsey
in the early morning hours of January 1, 2015, in which Mr. Dempsey posted a link to a video along
with the caption “This is my plan for Superior Court.” The linked video Mr. Dempsey described
as his “plan” was a music video titled “Bad Motherfucker” by the band “Biting Elbows” that
depicts— -via a first-person camera angle—a highly-realistic and ultraviolent fantasy in which the
protagonist assaults and murders dozens of men dressed in business suits.4 The video opens with a
graphic scene of a hooded man being shot in the head; the main character kills or mains eight men
(and one dog) with guns, knives, and a billiard ball in the first 60 seconds, after which the body
count climbs dramatically; and the video concludes with the protagonist murdering a final “bad
guy" using the man’s briefcase before turning to see a young child playing innocently on the floor
of its bedroom. As set forth in PCPAO Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Hugh Birgenheier‘s probable
cause declaration, Ms. Young’s clients reported that Mr. Dempsey frequently posted videos on his
Facebook page to “taunt them,” and were significantly concerned that Mr. Dempsey was “unstable”

and “would do that in court.”

After investigating the matter, The Tacoma Police referred Mr. Dempsey’s case to the
PCPAO, and on February 23, 2015, Mr. Dempsey was charged in Pierce County Superior Court
with one count of Intimidating a Judge and three counts of Felony Harassment. The Information

filed against Mr. Dempsey by the PCPAO on February 23 asserted one felony claim relating to each
of the four victims in the case: Pierce County Superior Court Judge Brian 'l‘ollefson, who was
presiding over the child custody dispute; Donna Mairs, the child’s grandmother; Darin Murphy, the
child’s grandfather; and Mariela Murphy, the child’s step-grandmother (all of whom were opposing
Mr. Dempsey’s efforts to obtain custody over the child, to whom he is not biologically related).
Exhibit A at 1-3.

2 The Grievance also cites RPC 8.4, “Misconduct,” as a “reference,” but fails to articulate how any of
Prosecutor Lindquist’s statements to KIRO News could have violated that rule.

3 State v. Dempsey, Pierce County Sup. Ct. No. 15-1-00747-7.
4 The video posted by Mr. Dempsey is available at https://youtu.be/Rgox84KE7iY.

Scott G. Busby

In response to media inquiries regarding the matter, Prosecutor Lindquist agreed to conduct
an interview with KIRO News the following day, February 24. A copy of the resulting KIRO News
article is attached as Exhibit B. Two statements of Prosecutor Lindquist’s are quoted in the article:

I “When you post a video of a guy going on a shooting rampage and say ‘this is my
plan for Superior Court,’ no judge is going to react well to tha .”

t “This is an ongoing investigation, but we wanted to move quick."

The case was assigned to Pierce County Superior Court Judge Ronald E. Culpepper. On
August 20, 2015, PCPAO Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Patrick Cooper amended the information

to add three additional Felony Harassment claims against Mr. Dempsey, alleging that Mr.
Dempsey’s post also victimized Heather Young, the attorney who was adverse to Mr. Dempsey;

Christine Hansen, the owner of the supervised visitation center where Mr. Dempsey had conducted
visitation with the child; and Tracy Burgess, the child’s guardian ad litem. Exhibit C.

Mr. Dempsey’s trial began on September 28, 2015. On the first day of trial, Judge
Culpepper granted Mr. Dempsey’s motion to dismiss the Information's first count of Intimidating
a Judge in violation of RCW 9A.73.160. On October 7, 2015, Judge Culpepper acquitted Mr.
Dempsey of all charges, based largely on the fact that most of the alleged victims were not Facebook
“friends” with Mr. Dempsey and therefore did not receive his alleged threat. Judge Culpepper’s
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are attached as Exhibit D.

Both of Prosecutor Lindquist’s comments to KIRO News were well within the bounds of
the Rules of Professional Conduct governing prosecutorial trial publicity. The first rule that the
Grievance alleges Prosecutor Lindquist violated, RPC 3.6, provides in pertinent part:

(a) A lawyer who is participating or has participated in the investigation or
litigation of a matter shall not make an extrajudicial statement that the
lawyer knows or reasonably should know will be disseminated by means

of public communication and will have a substantial likelihood of
materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in the matter.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a lawyer may state:

(1) the claim, offense or defense involved and, except when prohibited
by law, the identity of the persons involved; [and]

(2) information contained in a public record;
(3) that an investigation of a matter is in progress;

(4) the scheduling or result of any step in litigation;

Scott G. Busby
July 27, 2018

Page 4
[. . . . and]
(7) in a criminal case, in addition to subparagraphs (1) through (6);
[. . . .]
(iii) the fact, time and place of arrest . . . .
RPC 3.6 (emphasis added).

Extrajudicial statements falling within the categories set forth in paragraph (b) are
absolutely protected under the rule and “should not in any event be considered prohibited by the
general prohibition of paragraph (a).” RPC 36, cmt. 4; see also Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada,
501 US. 1030, 1033, 111 S. Ct. 2720 (1991) (referring to substantively identical provision in
Nevada Supreme Court rule governing trial publicity as a “safe harbor”). Moreover, RPC 3.6(a)
must function consistently with the generally—recognized duties of an elected prosecutor, which
include informing and educating the public about crime in their community, about the nature and
reasoning behind their of tice's charging decisions, and about the criminal justice system generally.
See ABA Criminal Justice Standards for the Prosecution Function, Standard 3-1.10(c), Functions
and Duties of the Prosecutor (4th Ed. 2015) (“[T]he prosecutor may make statements that inform
the public of the nature and extent of the prosecutor’s or law enforcement actions . . 3"”).5 The
comments to RPC 3.6 also recognize the benefit this duty provides to the public. See RPC 3.6, cmt.
l (referencing the “vital social interests served by the free dissemination of information . . . about
legal proceedings themselves” and the public’s “right to know about threats to its safety and
measures aimed at assuring its security").

The Grievance also argues that Prosecutor Lindquist violated RPC 3.8(f), “Special
Responsibilities of a Prosecutor.” That rule provides in pertinent part that prosecutors in criminal

cases shall:

[E]xcept for statements that are necessary to inform the public of the nature
and extent of the prosecutor’s action and that serve a legitimate law
enforcement purpose, refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have
a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused and
exercise reasonable care to prevent investigators, law enforcement personnel,
employees or other persons assisting or associated with the prosecutor in a criminal
case from making an extrajudicial statement that the prosecutor would be prohibited
from making under Rule 3.6 or this Rule.

5 The Washington revisions to RPC 3.8’s comments incorporate the ABA Criminal Justice Standards for the
Prosecution Function. See RPC 3.8, cmt. 1 (Wash. rev. 201 1) (ABA standards “are the product of prolonged
and careful deliberation by lawyers experienced in both criminal prosecution and defense”).

Scott G. Busby
July 27, 2018
Page 5

RPC 3.8(f) (emphasis added).

As with RPC 3.6, the comments to RPC 3.8 acknowledge that the rule must be applied
consistently with the basic duties of a prosecutor, noting that “the announcement of an indictment,
for example, will necessarily have severe consequences for the accused.” RPC 3.8, cmt. 5. The
comments to RPC 3.8 also make clear that it is subordinate to the safe harbor provisions of RPC
3.6(b), and that statements by a prosecutor describing the basic nature of charges brought by their
office, statements limited to information contained in the public record, and statements regarding
the time and place of arrest will not run afoul of RPC 3.8(f). See I'd. (“Nothing in this Comment is

intended to restrict the statements which a prosecutor may make which comply with Rule 3.6(b) or
3 .6(c).").

It is abundantly clear that Prosecutor Lindquist’s statements to KIRO News did not violate
either RPC 3.6 or RPC 3.8. For one, Prosecutor Lindquist's statement that Mr. Dempsey posted a
video of “a guy going on a shooting rampage” along with the caption “this is my plan for Superior
Court" is taken verbatim from DPA Birgenheier’s probable cause declaration, a document that had
been filed in the public record just one day earlier, and is thus absolutely protected by RPC
3.6(b)(2). Prosecutor Lindquist’s statement that the investigation into Mr. Dempsey’s threat was
“ongoing” and that the PCPAO “move[d] quic ” in apprehending Mr. Dempsey also both fall
within RPC 3.6’5 safe harbors for statements that an investigation is “in progress”; statements about
the “scheduling or result of any step in litigation”; and statements setting forth the “fact, time and
place of arrest”-———it is beyond dispute that Mr. Dempsey had been charged the day before the
interview, and was apprehended that same day. Because Prosecutor Lindquist‘s statements were

absolutely protected under RPC 3.6(b), they cannot constitute violations of either RPC 3.6(a) or
RPC 3.8. See RPC 3.6, cmt. 4.

Because there is no credible argument that Prosecutor Lindquist’s statements actually
violated the trial publicity rules, the Grievance focuses on two forms of prejudice that Mr. Dempsey
allegedly suffered as a result of the KIRO News interview. Eirst, the Grievance alleges that because
Mr. Dempsey turned himself in voluntarily, Prosecutor Lindquist’s statement that the PCPAO
“move[d] quick” to “round him up” implied that he was resisting arrest and “suggests I hold lawful
authority in disdain, and maybe even put up a fight.“ With respect, Mr. Dempsey’s attempt to
conjure prejudice from thin air falls entirely short. Prosecutor Lindquist’s measured, factual
statements did not in any way imply that Mr. Dempsey had resisted arrest, nor was Prosecutor
Lindquist required under the ethical rules to disclose the manner of Mr. Dempsey‘s arrest (indeed,
doing so may have exceeded the permissible bounds of statements regarding the “fact, time and
place of arrest” in RPC 3.6(b)(7)(iii)). Second, Mr. Dempsey alleges that he was forced to waive
his right to ajury trial out of fear that Prosecutor Lindquist’s statements somehow tainted the Pierce
Countyjury pool and prejudiced his right to a fair trial. This claim is disingenuous given the actual
record in the trial court, which indicates that Mr. Dempsey did not waive his right to a jury trial
until September 22, more than seven months after Prosecutor Lindquist’s statements, and only did
so because of concern about bias from the assigned trial judge given that one of the charges against

 

Scott G. Busby
July 27, 2018
Page 6

him was Intimidation of a Judge. See Exhibit E at 4 (trial minutes reflecting that “Defendant wishes
to waive jury at this time, as Count 1 (intimidation of ajudge) has been dismissed”).6

In addition to the fact that Prosecutor Lindquist’s statements fell squarely within the safe
harbor provisions of RPC 3.6(b), and that none of the alleged prejudice Mr. Dempsey identities
actually materialized, there are very strong policy reasons why the allegations in the Grievance
should be dismissed outright. Elected prosecutors like Prosecutor Lindquist have a duty to inform
their constituents of the charges brought by their office, and they must be given a degree of latitude
to explain the nature and basis for those charges. If ODC were to find that basic comments like
Prosecutor Lindquist’s statements to KIRO News run afoul of the trial publicity rules, it would
effectively muzzle prosecutors throughout the state and would give criminal defendants and
prosecutors' political opponents a powerful new weapon with which to harass and impugn elected
officials for simply doing their job. A cursory review of Mr. Dempscy's web site makes clear that
he is in not one but both camps, as the site contains a substantial quantity of articles impugning
Prosecutor Lindquist's ethics and integrity, including a “Malfeasance Guide”; links to numerous
editorial articles criticizing Prosecutor Lindquist; several pages discussing the failed recall
campaign against Prosecutor Lindquist; lengthy descriptions of his ongoing child custody dispute;
and even links to a Twitter account titled “Fake Mark Lindquist” containing exceptionally
inflammatory and racially-tinged commentary about Prosecutor Lindquist...f Pcrusing Mr.
Dempsey’s web site for even a few minutes makes clear that the Grievance arises from his
animosity toward Prosecutor Lindquist, the PCPAO, and the justice system generally—not from a
purported ethical lapse by Prosecutor Lindquist back in February of 201 5.

In short, Prosecutor Lindquist respectfully submits that ODC should summarily dismiss the
Grievance without investigation under ELC 5.7(a). The Grievance is without basis in fact or law,
and none of the interests of the trial publicity rules would be served by giving credence to Mr.
Dempsey’s vexatious and harassing allegations. Prosecutor Lindquist is a public official tasked
with explaining to the public the work his office does. So long as he abides by RPC 3.6(b) (which
he undeniably did here), Prosecutor Lindquist must be given the freedom to field basic interview
questions from local news outlets—it is not only his right, it is his duty.

5 In the interest of clarity, it should be noted that Mr. Dempsey first waived his right to a jury trial on
September 22, 2015; withdrew that waiver on the morning of September 28; and then finally waived his
right on the morning of September 29. See Exhibit E at 1, 3, 4.

I See http://dempseybarcomplaint.info/dishonestSG.html (linking to Twitter post reading “Check out what I
did to this guy. I BURIED the little nigger in charges! In the end, all I could prove was that he punched a
guy once. That's Lindquist Justicel”).

That I am a deputy prdsecuting attorney for Pierce County and I am familiar with the police
9 report andfor investigation conducted by the TACOMA POLICE DEPARTMENT, incident number
150120906;
10 That the police report and/or investigation provided me the following information;
1 I That in Pierce County, Washington, the defendant committed four counts of felony harassment on or
between January 1, thru January 24, 2015
12

On January 12, 2015, Tacoma Police were contacted by H. Young, an attorney. She said she was involved
13 as an attorney for D. Mairs in a custody dispute with the defendant. Mairs currently has custody of the child.
Young said Mairs had been notified of a disturbing link on the defendant’s Facebook page under the title “This is
my plan for Superior Court." The link was to a video link. On its face, it did not appear to involve a link to a
14 violent video. However, the link displays a video of a first person, or shooter, perspective of an individual who
shootslkills multiple people using a variety of weapons including several firearms and knives. At the end of the
video, a young child disappears with use of some type of teleporter device. The video is described by detectives as
graphic and disturbing. Young noted she, Mairs and Murphy were concerned about the possibility of some type of
shooting or mass killing occurring at the County City Building where hearings for the case were typically held.
16 Police were able to confirm a link on the defendant's Facebook page showing it was posted on January 1,
2015. The video is one titled "Bad Motherfucker“. Judge Tollefson was the assigned judge to this case through early
17 January. The state reserves the right to tile additional charges as to Judge Tollefson. The Facebock page of the
defendant was first seen by the wife of D. Murphy. D. Murphy states the family has access to the defendant's
18 Facebock and he sometimes posts things on the “timeline” to "taunt them." Murphy says the defendant tries to
intimidate them. Murphy states he believes the defendant is “unstable“. He states the defendant is a “win at all
costs“ type of individual and he is concerned that he may take off with the child involved in the custody dispute- D.
19 Mairs also is Facebook friends with the defendant. She stated after viewing the video, she was I"sickened" and her
Iirst thought was that he "would do that in court“ and she was scared. She said he may have posted it as a scare

20 tactic but couldn't overcome the equal fear that he was serious. The video was very realistic.
H. Young notes she has been handling family law cases since 1998. She states she has never made a report

to law enforcement about a case. She states they have posted his picture at their office and have advised staff to call
21 91 1 if he does appear.

15

C. Hanson is the supervisor for Community Family Services which monitors the supervised child visitation.

22 After viewing the link, she cancelled the visitation monitors and compared it the “Powell" case where the father was
a suspect in his wife's disappearance and then later killed himself and two young children during a supervised visit

PIERCE 00.. Wash. - Prosecutors say when John Dempsey became angry over a child custody dispute. he

went on his Facebook page and posted the line. "This is my plan for Superior Court."a|ong with an extremely
violent music video that included mass shootings. stabbings and such graphic death scenes that he was arrested

on four counts of making threats.

"When you post a video of a guy going on a shooting rampage and say 'this is my plan for Superior Court. no
judge is going to react well to that." said Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney Mark Lindquist.

Family members and friends quoted in court documents seem to agree. saying Dempsey sometimes posts
things on his timeline to taunt them. One family member told investigators he "believes the defendant is

unstable“ another described Dempsey as "a win at all costs type of individual."

Family members who came to court as Dempsey. 45. pleaded not guilty to four counts of felony harassment
didn't want to talk on the record. but one said the threat could turn into a Charlie Hebdo situation. referring to

mass shootings at the French newspaper several weeks ago.

Dempsey was also arrested. but not charged. on suspicion of threatening Pierce County Superior Court
Judge Brian Tollefson. who Is presiding over his custody case.

Lindquiet said investigators consider Dempsey a threat. so his office didn't wait to jail him. "This is
