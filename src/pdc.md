On at least x occasions,
James Lynch, an employee of Pierce County,
violated 
RCW 42.17A.550, which governs use of public 
funds for political purposes.

I have included an article from 
the Tacoma News Tribune:



The news article quotes the Pierce County executive's
evaluation of Wikipedia activities carried out
by Mr. Lynch as having no "no county business".
Based on this, I've concluded that the motive
was political business.

In addition, I'm providing the actual record
provided by Pierce County regarding activities
from Mr. Lynch's personal computer on just one day
in question. This record 
includes evidence of other violations of 
RCW 42.17A.550.

In particular,
on the day i question,
employee Lynch visited marklindquist.org, 
thepolitical website of Lindquist, unrelated to Pierce 
County operational business, and clearly
a platform funded by non-tax funds for the
non-county business of re-electing the current
prosecutor.

Tax funds going to political campaigns
are unlawful because they undermine faith in
democratic institutions. We rely on our government
to spend each cent smartly to serve government,
not politician, needs. It's unsettling to see
the full scope of brazen illegality 
and malfeasance revealed by
just one log on a public website and
one sample day on a work computer.

Obvious public persuasion pipeline arrangements,
such as with the Tacoma Weekly, aren't subject to
PDC regulation due to the loophole in
RCW 42.17a.555, but these articles are clearly
authored to feature the prosecutor, rather than
crime victims, in an uncritical platform that 
presents itself as news.  

Even more disturbing, this elected official
released a previous media manager from employment when she 
advised against an appearance on national television
about a murder trial that was underway.
That violation has triggered a disciplinary hearing
scheduled for December. 
Violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct
cannot be, by their nature, county business.
So the appareance on Nancy Grace was not county business.
All time expended by at least 4 county employees
was a use of tax funds for political purposes.

Name recognition is valuable
in politics. 

very ambitious modifications. 

These activities funded by taxes, 
occurred to persuade 
people to vote for the canddiate.

This was clearly a non-trivial, ongoing
campaign that violated RCW 42.17A.550 at least
x times.

I hope you do read reputable sources including
the TNT, and investigate independently if
the violation is obvious enough. With this letter,
I provide additional details that should assist you
in determining what was done with tax funds,
and what purpose the actions served.

From the log of activities on the Wikipedia
page in question, we learn:

1. On Feb x, at y, James Lynch xxx

According to his Linked In profile, 
James Lynch was hired by the PCPAO around mon, year.
Records also show Busto Report, and Recall.
Mr. Lynch describes his work as: "shaping perceptions".

Based on his unique specialty, and with the seriousness
of RCW 42.17A.550 violations, I wonder what
steps Pierce County has taken to safegard public
funds in this instance.
