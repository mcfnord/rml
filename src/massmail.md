<title>James Lynch: Paid by taxpayers to re-elect his boss</title>
# James Lynch campaigns for Mark Lindquist at taxpayer expense

How much evidence do you need?

On Monday, the Tacoma News Tribune reported that
[James Lynch sees part of his job as hiding unpleasant
facts about his boss](https://maryforprosecutor.com/a-good-use-of-your-tax-dollars-erasing-embarrassing-lindquist-facts-from-wikipedia/).

One fact the TNT didn't mention: The same public record
fingering Lynch also showed he spends time on
Lindquist's _candidate_ website.

On Tuesday, Mark Lindquist was [hit with another
bar complaint](bc.html) for misuse of the media.

On Wednesday, James sends out a mass-email
containing an essay his boss wrote, that was previously
published in Tacoma Weekly, where Mr. Lindquist
often publishes a column.

For Lynch's $86,000/yr government salary, Mark Lindquist gets a lot for his campaign. 
But what do Pierce County taxpayers get? A whitewash.

Subject: Prosecutor Looking For Public Servants
 
In his latest regular Tacoma Weekly column, 
Prosecutor Mark Lindquist offers some thoughts on the 
values he looks for when hiring public servants.

[The essay is cringeworthy, so I won't drag you through
it here, [but you can read the rest online.](https://tacomaweekly.com/guest-editorial/prosecutor-looking-for-public-servants/)]


-----------------------------


The only person saying Mark Lindquist is a skilled leader 
is Mark Lindquist, through his publicist, James Lynch. 
Mass-emails like this one are properly called campaigning, 
not carrying out the business of Pierce County's largest 
and official law firm. That James Lynch has a government 
job where his primary focus is getting his boss elected 
should outrage all Pierce County taxpayers.
