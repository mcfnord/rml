# People whitewash Mark Lindquist's Wikipedia entry

**[Mark Lindquist, American lawyer and author](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lindquist)**.

For many years, changes to the _Law Career_ section would be replaced with this simple, glowing review:

_Lindquist has been with the Pierce County Prosecutor's Office for more than 20 years. He was 
appointed in 2009, elected in 2010, and re-elected in 2014. As District Attorney, he has instituted 
innovative crime-fighting initiatives._

In Wikipedia lingo, this description violates many principles of NPOV (stating opinions as 
facts, with no citation of reliable sources). I believe Mark's publicist at Simon & Schuster was the vandal.

In March, 2018, James Lynch [attempted to deface the page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mark_Lindquist&oldid=828668826#Vandalism_originating_from_Pierce_County_ISP). 
Mr. Lynch earns $86,000/yr as Communication and Public Information Coordinator for the Prosecuting Attorney, Mr. Lindquist.

I know this because he used his work computer, and so we requested that the county identify the operator of the IP address involved.

The county provided detailed logs of external resources requested by the computer of jlynch.

He visits:

* [http://marklindquist.org/](http://marklindquist.org), the website of his boss.
* [http://lindquistdental.org/](http://lindquistdental.org). There must be a dentist in Mark's family.
* [http://satterberg.org/](http://satterberg.org). This is some kind of non-profit for the King County prosecutor's family?
* [http://nwfacts.com/](http://nwfacts.com). A newspaper for black people in the Pacific Northwest.
* [http://www.co.pierce.wa.us/admin/](http://www.co.pierce.wa.us/admin/). This is his job.


# See NPOV - Neutral Point of View

[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view)
is a fundamental Wikipedia principle.

_All encyclopedic content on Wikipedia must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), 
which means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial 
bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic._

I've presented significant views of very reliable sources. The vandal has not.


## BLP - Biography of a Living Person

The longer passage meets NPOV and BLP standards.

[Crying BLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Crying_%22BLP!%22) is a whole tactic, 
turns out. The vandal on this page asserts it as a defense every single time. But wait! 
"It's not OK to block someone for citing the *Washington Post* in a matter with which you 
disagree." The vandal is clearly using this standard as a club, and failing to engage
the community in resolving the disagreement... because the vandal knows full well
BLP is no cause for these removals. The vandal is literally paid to play this game.


## Possible explanations

Reasonable people disagree. It happens all the time. One 
man's NPOV BLP violation might be another's fully compliant 
prose. But is that what's going on here?

Or is a party working hard to avoid unfortunate facts about 
Mark Lindquist, author and lawyer?


## The vandal uses the language of Wikipedia against Wikipedia

Comments accompanying these changes are interesting. 

Let's examine this claim.

Going back through [the log](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_Lindquist&action=history),
I see S&S, perhaps Simon & Schuster, a publisher. I imagine they review what's said about their authors.

Here's a vandalism by S&S:

![](vandal-jan-9.jpg)

So... account S&S1109 adds a link to Simon and Schuster,
and probably believes this is a sound source. Yeah, I think I'm a sound source!
The reference for the claim this subject
"... has written articles, essays, and reviews for several publications"
is claimed in the reference page, but not proven. Self-citation by S&S1109
to the S&S page doesn't bode well for the quality of that source.

(S&S1109 has now accumulated [3 warnings on their User talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:S%26S1109).
This is quite heartening! I'm clearly joined by two other editors whose investigation goes as far as my own,
and comes to identical conclusions. No, this isn't a fluff piece for Mark on behalf of his publicist, 
who abuses Wikipedia by misusing the language of Wikipedia. Thank goodness there are editors willing to
stand up to this systematic abuse.)

The other source about Mark Lindquist is written by... wait for it... Mark Lindquist! 
That's so clearly not NPOV. I guess if you can't earn a reputation, you can make one up?

Who is the vandal? There might be two, or just one.
Even without a name, or a place, the counter-party 
is notable for their *precision*. Not only do they
revert to the unsubstantiated prose, but the
comment in the log is so *precise* in asserting
three different Wikipedia crimes. In the same log,
I explain there are no violations in the well-sourced
prose I prefer. If my opponent persuades an admin,
maybe that would get me banned. My opponent is
cunning. So... I've prepared this web site.

The vandal should familiarize themself with [the Achieving Neutrality 
section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Achieving_neutrality) 
of the NPOV article. But the vandal won't. Because the vandal is paid to pave and blame, not 
seek NPOV. NPOV information is often very critical of the topic's performance in office.


# See How to apply NPOV to judges and law careers

Trying to understand what's going on, I began wondering 
about Wikipedia pages of other elected officials. 
Wikipedia's BLP standard raises the bar regarding 
biographies of living people. Americans are accustomed to 
broad leeway in criticism of elected officials, but BLP's 
standard is still quite adequate. I'm not interested in 
falsehoods or expressing my own opinion on Wikipedia. 
Mystery Man has his opinion, and I have my own, but neither 
belong here. So I presume (a) the BLP standards should be 
met for all elected officials, just like any other living 
person, and (b) matters of controversy might be subject to 
facts that both strengthen and mitigate concern.

I expect to see claims of BLP violations made in the edit 
logs for elected officials, but I want to see where and 
why.


## Prosecutors are committed to the court, not just the public

And that's where Mr. Lindquist's choices have caused quite a bit of wasted effort and 
frustration.

## Other elected officials in Washington State

Do they have image consultants paving criticisms on their Wikipedia pages?


## Does a prosecutor's law career hinge on specific prosecutions?

This question interests me. How can we compare the conviction of a murderer
by one jury to the ruling of the state's Supreme Court? 

One certainly hopes a prosecutor's career includes convictions.
While the crime may be newsworthy, and the verdict's findings 
something Wikipedia would call an NPOV, convictions by a prosecutor
are expected and might not be noteworthy. On the spectrum presented by the old addage,
such verdicts are more "dog bites man" than "man bites dog".
Such details can be factual, from a neutral point of view, but 
I think they're less noteworthy.

Compare a verdict about a prosecutor to a verdict about a criminal.
The one about the prosecutor is more noteworthy to the law career section.
The verdict about the criminal might fit best in the Wikipedia page about the crime.


## Are Verdicts Germane? Are Courts an NPOV?

This is something I've This is where things get 
interesting. We are accustomed to thinking of legitimate 
journalism as posessing a neutral point of view.
But does a legal verdict have the same legitimacy?
Or more? To answer this question, reflect on what
a court trial is. A news reporter might gather sources,
including sources that compliment or contradict one another.
A court also does this, before determining what's true.
But courts also have special powers journalists don't have.
A court can force parties to surrender details particular
to a dispute. In a criminal matter, protections may
exist for the accused, but in civil court, judges
and counter-parties can and do seek evidence
that harms or helps the case of one side or another.

So both a genuine journalist and a civil court judge
have similar committments to a neutral point of view. 
But courts have additional powers to access information.
This must strengthen the accuracy of their judgements.
Additionally, courts have no market motivation to
make headlines, or emphasize salicious details.

Court judgements are therefore solidly in compliance with 
Wikipedia NPOV standards.

Having concluded this, I went on to wonder which courts
are empowered to produce the most neutral NPOV judgements.
At the top is our state's Supreme Court, where a panel of many
distinguished judges, rather than just one, author
each ruling. Not only can a majority write a verdict,
but a minority of judges can produce an alternative
verdict they believe is closer to the truth.
It appears to me such a mechanism comes the closest
to NPOV of any source I'm aware of.

Man, I'd go a little further, and say: 
Whatever the state Supreme Court has said specifically about
the Pierce County Prosecutor in his professional cacpacity
**implicitly** meets the NPOV standard for the section
on his Law Career. As a lawyer, he has committments to the court.
The state's highest court has ruled against him and determined times where he
has failed to meet his committments. Every word of the state Supreme Court
about the performance of the subject in a courtroom probably meets Wikipedia
standards about the subject. It's unusual for misbehavior by an elected official
to reach the state's Supreme Court, and when it does, they are the last line of
defense for NPOV review of such misbehavior. They are implicitly and utterly NPOV,
by Wikipedia standards.

I want to look around and see where Wikipedia pages use the 
[Cite Court Template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Cite_court), as
it's apparent there's some debate about whether court rulings are valid
sources on Wikipedia. The presence of a template to cite them should be a clue!
Verdicts about Maurice Clemmons go on that criminal's page, and
verdicts about Mark Lindquist go on that lawyer's page. Pretty simple stuff!

But do you know of a politician in our state who spends more 
time and obviously money on cultivating an image?
I'm thinking of expanding this page to cover all the various ways
Mark works *incredibly* hard to present an image of his job performance
that is strikingly different from accounts made to the Bar Association,
and verdicts of the state Supreme Court. And to realize he bills a lot
of this P.R. work to the taxpayers of Pierce County is a scandal
in itself. The people of my hometown deserve a lot better than this
guy.

That's all for now. Now enjoy [LadyBug Today](http://ladybug.today).
