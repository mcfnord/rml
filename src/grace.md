Re: Grievance of John Cain against Mark Evans Lindquist
ODC File No. 16-00748

Dear Ms. Greer and Mr. Cain:

We have completed our investigation, and we write to advise you of our conclusions before we
report this matter to a Review Committee of the Disciplinary Board. Our analysis is based on
interviews of Jared Ausserer, Gregory Greer, Judge Jack Nevin, Heather Songer, and Mike
Stewart; a review of the court file in _State of Washington v. Skylar Nemetz_, Pierce County Superior Court No. 14-1-04212, and a review of the documentation listed at the end of this letter.

<mark>We are recommending that the Review Committee order this matter to hearing.</mark> If you wish to
provide additional information or address our analysis, you should do so on or before October 9,
2017. The Review Committee will be provided with the documentation listed at the end of this
letter and with anything further that you send to us. All materials will become public when and
if the Review Committee orders the matter to hearing or orders that an admonition be issued,
unless the materials are covered by a protective order.

Mr. Cain, a Pierce County criminal defense lawyer, filed this grievance against Mr. Lindquist,
the elected Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney (PA). He alleges that PA Lindquist violated
RPC 3.6 and RFC 3.8(f) when he gave an interview on _Nancy Grace_, a nationally broadcast
television show, about an ongoing criminal jury trial. Ms. Greer represents PA Lindquist.

# See FACTS AS DISCLOSED BY INVESTIGATION

_State v. Nemetz_: The Charges

On October 22, 2014, Skylar Nemetz was charged in the Pierce County Superior Court with
murder in the first degree.<sup>1</sup> The information, filed in the name of Prosecuting Attorney (PA)
Mark Lindquist, alleged that Mr. Nemetz, with premeditated intent, caused the death of his wife,
Danielle Nemetz, while armed with a rifle.<sup>2</sup> The Declaration for Determination of Probable
Cause set forth some of the alleged facts related to the shooting, including Mr. Nemetz’s
experience with firearms and the statements he made about the shooting.

_State v. Nemetz_ was assigned to Judge Jack Nevin. Deputy Prosecuting Attorney (DPA)
Gregory Greer and DPA Jared Ausserer represented the State of Washington. Lawyer Michael
Stewart represented Mr. Nemetz. For months, the case received substantial media coverage, not
all of the highest quality.

**The First _Nancy Grace_ Interview**

On December 3, 2014, with _State v. Nemetz_ set for a jury trial on May 4, 2015, PA Lindquist
gave a telephonic interview about the case on the national television show _Nancy Grace_. The
show, which ran for more than a decade on the CNN Headline News (HLN) network, was well
known for its aggressive coverage of “tabloid crime stories.” “Nancy Grace to Leave HLN After
More Than a Decade,” _New York Times_, June 30, 2016. The show’s eponymous hostess was
“criticized frequently as promoting a one-sided view of the stories she covers, castigating those
she perceives to be guilty without waiting for rulings from jury or judge.” I_d. “Since her show
began in 2005,” wrote a _New York Times_ media critic, “the presumption of innocence has found
a willful enemy in the former prosecutor turned broadcast judge-and-jury.” “TV Justice Thrives
on Fear,” _New York Times_, May 22, 2011. Besides Ms. Grace herself, the show featured “a
contingent of experts who have all the independence of a crew of trained seals.” Id.

In his December 3, 2014 interview on _Nancy Grace_, PA Lindquist described some of the
information contained in the Declaration for Determination of Probable Cause relating to Mr.
Nemetz’s experience with firearms and the statements he made about the shooting. <mark>But in
addition, PA Lindquist expressed his opinions about Mr. Nemetz’s credibility, his motive, and
the quality of his anticipated defense. PA Lindquist opined, for example, that what Mr. Nemetz
said about the shooting “undercuts his claim that this was an accident.” He Opined that Mr.
Nemetz “may have imagined that she [Danielle Nemetz] was doing something, cheating on
him,” and “to me that just gives him motive to murder her,” adding that, in his view, a jury
would say “that’s motive for murder.” He Opined that Mr. Nemetz’s claims that the shooting
was accidental “just don‘t make sense," adding, “I think the motive of jealousy makes it more
clear that this was intentional.”</mark>

A full transcript of the December 3, 2014 episode of _Nancy Grace_ is at Appendix A. The portion
of the episode devoted to _State v. Nemetz_ follows, with PA Lindquist’s comments in boldface.

<ul>(END VIDEO CLIP)

GRACE: It is not fitting together for me. What we have is a young wife, Danielle
Nemetz, found, shot dead in the back of the head, sitting at her home computer.
Her husband has given several different stories about what happened. But one of
them is as he was trying to put his assault rifle on safety and accidentally did that
as he was pointing at the back of her head. I‘m hearing in my ear, I‘m just now
being joined by special guest, Pierce County prosecuting attorney, Mark
Lindquist. Mark, thanks so much for being with us.

**MARK LINDQUIST, PIERCE COUNTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY
(via telephone): Happy to be here, Nancy. Thank you.**

GRACE: Man, you‘ve got a tough job. I remember the ten years that I prosecuted
felonies, every day, I would think, well, I‘ve seen it all now, until the next day.
How many stories, Mark Lindquist, do we know that Skyler Nemetz gave about
the shooting death of his wife?

**LINDQUIST: He gave basically three different stories, which obviously
undercuts his claim that this was an accident. Initially, he claimed his wife
shot herself. Second, he claimed the weapon went off accidentally when the
stock bumped against his leg. And third, he admitted that he pointed the gun
at the back of her head, and took off the safety and pulled the trigger, but
claimed he didn‘t know the gun was loaded.**

GRACE: Now this is the problem, Mark Lindquist, as you probably already
know. Some pe0p1e out there will think, if he thought his wife was having an
affair, whether she was or wasn‘t, that that will somehow lower the charge or
nullify the charge. But as I have the “I was mad” argument is not a legal defense
under the law, Mark.

**LINDQUIST: Right. And actually I think the motive of jealousy makes it
more clear that this was intentional.**

GRACE: Why do you say that, Mark?

**LINDQUIST: Well, first, let me step back a little and note that this
defendant is highly trained in the use of firearms and it doesn‘t make any
sense that he would point a loaded gun at the back of his wife‘s head, click
the safety off and pull the trigger. We know the number one rule of gun
safety is assumed all guns are loaded.**

GRACE: You know what, Mark? Even when I would bring a gun in as evidence,
number one, I hate handling guns because I‘m the victim of gun violence. But
always, even after my investigator would hand me the gun in open court, I would
turn it away from the jury and down to the ground if I wanted to demonstrate
anything because of the number one rule of gun safety is assume it‘s loaded. Go ahead, Mark.

**LINDQUIST: And always point the gun in a safe direction. He knows what
he’s doing with guns. He‘s angry for whatever reason, whether it’s an actual
affair or imagined affair, and his multiple claims that it was an accident just
don’t make sense.**

GRACE: An accident? Was there a point where he said his wife shot herself?

**LINDQUIST: Yes, that‘s what he told the neighbor initially.**

GRACE: Why is it that the neighbor -- you know what? Unleash the lawyers. In
addition to the prosecuting attorney, Mark Lindquist, with me, Randy Kessler,
Alex Sanchez and also with me, Dr. Ish Major, board certified psychiatrist out of
New York. Doctor Ish Major, first to you. When does jealousy take over your
body so somehow it makes sense to you to murder your wife?

DR. ISH MAJOR, BOARD CERTIFIED PSYCHIATRIST: You know what? It
sounds like he was building up and got to a point where he was in a jealous rage.
The question I have, Nancy, is what is the history here? Guys just don‘t come
home and get jealous and shoot their wife in the back of the head. So I‘m betting
there‘s a history of violence, maybe abuse or in the very at least intimidation
going on.

GRACE: Randy Kessler, Alex Sanchez, taking that into account what Ish Major
has just told us, give me your best defense, Alex Sanchez, I‘m braced.

ALEX SANCHEZ, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: The best defense is that he‘s going
to be ending up pleading manslaughter in this case on the grounds of extreme
emotional disturbance. He was in the military, under stress. He comes home and

finds out his wife may be having an affair with somebody. Somebody is giving
alcohol --

GRACE: It was a bottle of liquor.

SANCHEZ: Yes, bottle of liquor, but what is that for? What do you think is going
on there?

GRACE: Are you asking me to speculate because a family friend gives this
family a bottle of liquor. Let me ask you something, when you go to a Christmas
party or a dinner, I bet you give people a bottle of wine. Does that mean you‘re
sleeping with the lady?

SANCHEZ: The first thing you need to do is get real. A man is giving a bottle of
alcohol to a man‘s wife while this guy is away. That doesn‘t look good and he has
intentions that are inconsistent with the marital vows.

GRACE: OK, to Mark Lindquist, Pierce County prosecuting attorney. That‘s a
perfect argument to a jury when some defense attorney tries this, is how many
people on a jury, whether they drink or not, how many times when they go to a
party or a dinner or get together, do they take a bottle of wine? Does that mean
you‘re sleeping with the lady that lives there? No, it does not. I guess, you‘re
ready for that, Mark.

**LINDQUIST: I‘m a prosecutor, not a psychiatrist, so I look at the evidence,
and the fact that he may have imagined that she was doing something,
cheating on him, to me that just gives him motive to murder her. I don‘t
think there‘s a jury out there that will say, maybe she was cheating and
therefore this is manslaughter. On the contrary, they will say that’s motive
for murder.**

After the interview, a representative of _Nancy Grace_ sent a note to the Pierce County Prosecuting
Attorney’s Office (PCPAO) thanking the staff for assisting with the interview, adding: “Nancy
loved Mark!"

# See 48 Hours

The trial was continued three more times to January 4, 2016. Meanwhile, in late 2015,
representatives of the CBS television series _48 Hours_, described (by CBS) as “television's most
popular true-crime series,” began planning an episode devoted to _State v. Nemetz_. To make
logistical arrangements, _48 Hours_ representatives worked mainly through Heather Songer, the
Communication and Public Information Coordinator for the PCPAO. The episode on _State v.
Nemetz_ was to include interviews with DPA Greer and DPA Ausserer. DPA Greer and DPA
Ausserer insisted, however, that no such interview be disseminated by means of public
communication until after a verdict was reached, so as not to prejudice the proceeding. At DPA
Greer’s insistence, _48 Hours_ agreed to this condition in writing.

A representative of _48 Hours_ also contacted Michael Stewart, Mr. Nemetz’s lawyer, to request
an interview. Mr. Stewart declined the invitation, and sent the following email to DPA Greer
and DPA Ausserer on December 2, 2015:

<ul>Dear Mr. Greer and Mr. Ausserer,

I had the pleasure of a surprise visit this afternoon from Greg Fisher and Erin
Moriarty from CBS News. I declined to be interviewed. They left an impression
with me however that you have not declined to be interviewed. I wish to remind
you of RPC 3.6. No doubt you are familiar with this rule. You are undoubtedly
also aware of rule 3.8 which falls right on its heels. Please read them together.

Thank you, gentleman.</ul>

DPA Ausserer replied the next day:

<ul>Mr. Stewart,

We are familiar with the RPC's, which state we shall refrain from extra-judicial
statements that we know will be disseminated and will have a substantial
likelihood of materially prejudicing the trial. None of our statements to CBS will
be disseminated prior to verdict and have no likelihood of prejudicing the trial.
Similarly, RPC 3.8 specifically states that there is nothing in this rule that is
intended to restrict a statement that would be proper under RPC 3.6.

Thank you for your concern.</ul>

# See State v. Nemetz: The Trial

The trial of _State v. Nemetz_ began on January 4, 2016 with hearings on various pretrial motions,
including a motion regarding media coverage. In an Order Regarding Media Coverage, Judge
Nevin ordered, among other things, that no interviews would take place “within [the] presence,
sight or hearing of any juror . . . or when there is a reasonable likelihood that a juror or jurors
may be present.” After six days of pretrial hearings, jury selection began on January 14, 2016.
After three days of jury selection, a jury was sworn on January 20, 2016. The jurors then heard
12 days of trial testimony, including the testimony of Skylar Nemetz on February 10-11, 2016.
On February 11, 2016, the jurors were released and the trial recessed until February 22, 2016.

**The Second _Nancy Grace_ Interview**

On the morning of February 16, 2016, while the trial was in recess, Mike Duffy, a representative
of _Nancy Grace_, telephoned Mr. Stewart and asked if he would speak about _State v. Nemetz_ on
Nancy Grace later that day. Mr. Stewart declined. He told Mr. Duffy that the trial was ongoing,
and that he would be willing to comment at some later date, but only after the jury reached a
verdict.

On the same morning, Mr. Duffy telephoned Heather Songer and told her he would like PA
Lindquist to make another appearance on the show later that day to talk about _State v. Nemetz_
again. Ms. Songer thought the proposal was a bad idea, given the sensationalistic character of
the show and the fact that the trial was ongoing. She believed, however, that PA Lindquist
would be very interested nonetheless.

Ms. Songer went first to DPA Greer and DPA Ausserer and told them about the _Nancy Grace_
proposal. Both DPA Greer and DPA Ausserer strongly Opposed an appearance by PA Lindquist
or anyone else from the PCPAO on _Nancy Grace_ while the trial of _State v. Nemetz_ was ongoing.
They were both concerned that such an appearance could prejudice the proceeding, especially if
one or more jurors saw the show. They both believed, however, that PA Lindquist would not
want to pass up the opportunity to appear on a national television show, even one like Nancy
Grace, which, according to DPA Ausserer, DPA Greer said was “crap.”

Ms. Songer then spoke to PA Lindquist. She explained that both DPA Greer and DPA Ausserer
believed an appearance on _Nancy Grace_ while the trial of _State v. Nemetz_ was ongoing was a
bad idea. PA Lindquist then brought DPA Ausserer into the conversation. DPA Ausserer
expressed his discomfort with an appearance on _Nancy Grace_ while the trial was ongoing, but,
according to Ms. Songer, he did so less forcefully than he had earlier in conversation with her
and DPA Greer when PA Lindquist was not present. PA Lindquist made it clear that he wanted
to do the interview, notwithstanding the concerns of Ms. Songer, DPA Ausserer, and DPA Greer.

Meanwhile, Mike Duffy, a representative of _Nancy Grace_, sent the following email to Ms.
Songer:

<ul>Hi Heather. Here are the types of questions for today’s show. If there’s anything
you can't answer, just let me know and Nancy totally understands.

Mike Duffy
[Telephone redacted]

HOW IMPORTANT IS NEMETZ’S HISTORY WITH FIREARMS TO THE
STATES CASE?

WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE DIFFERENT STORIES NEMETZ
GAVE POLICE?

HOW DO ALL THE DIFFERENT STATEMENTS NEMETZ GAVE POLICE
ADD UP AGAINST HIM?

HOW MUCH DOES EVIDENCE OF A MOTIVE HELP IN A CASE LIKE
THIS?

HOW DO YOU SHOW NEEMETZ’S [sic] ACTIONS AFTER THE
SHOOTING MAKE IT CLEAR THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT?

WHAT IS THE MOST COMPELLIN G EVIDENCE AGAINST NEMETZ?</ul>

Ms. Songer replied that she would go over the questions with PA Lindquist. After consulting
with PA Lindquist, Ms. Songer replied at 1:59 p.m.:

<ul>Yes, this is a go. It looks like we can address everything except questions 3 and 6.</ul>

Later the same day, February 16, 2016, PA Lindquist gave a telephonic interview about _State v.
Nemetz_ on _Nancy Grace_. Before the interview, PA Lindquist had DPA Ausserer place certain
public records related to the case on a desk so that he could refer to them. PA Lindquist told
DPA Ausserer to make sure he (PA Lindquist) didn’t “deviate” from information contained in
the public record. DPA Ausserer and Ms. Songer were with PA Lindquist in his office during
the interview, but they could hear only PA Lindquist’s side of the call.

In his February 16, 2016 interview on _Nancy Grace_, PA Lindquist again described some of the
information contained in the Declaration for Determination of Probable Cause relating to Mr.
Nemetz’s experience with firearms and the statements he made about the shooting. But in
addition, <mark>PA Lindquist expressed his opinions about Mr. Nemetz’s motive, about the inferences
to be drawn from the evidence, about the significance of certain evidence, and about the strength
of the evidence.</mark> PA Lindquist opined, for example, that “the motive in this case was jealousy.”
He opined that “[t]he evidence suggests the defendant thought Danielle was fooling around . . . .”
He opined that Mr. Nemetz’s experience with firearms was “critical to the case” and that certain
other putative facts were “highly probative.” And although he was never specifically asked the
“add up” question (number 3) that his interviewer was told he could not address, PA Lindquist
volunteered his opinion that “it’s his actions combined with his statements . . . and his experience
with firearms that add up to murder, rather than an accident.” That was, according to PA
Lindquist, the ultimate issue to be determined: “That’s the whole defense. And that’s the whole
question. Was this an accident? Was it intentional?”

In addition, PA Lindquist represented as fact at least one allegation that was not in evidence at
trial. PA Lindquist responded “Right” to Nancy Grace’s assertion that “it’s highly, highly
probative when you are at home, you’re the only other person in the home, and you were in the
middle of a fast and furious fight with your wife over something that has just happened.” <mark>In fact,
there was no evidence that Mr. Nemetz and his wife were involved in any fight, “fast and
furious” or otherwise, just before the shooting.</mark> PA Lindquist also <mark>repeated the allegation,
contained in the Declaration for Determination of Probable Cause, that Mr. Nemetz had initially
told a witnesses that Mrs. Nemetz shot herself while cleaning a rifle. Much was made of this
alleged fact by Nancy Grace, by one of her “contingent of experts,”<sup>3</sup> and by PA Lindquist
himself. But the witness, a neighbor of Mr. Nemetz, had testified at trial on January 27, 2016
that he did not remember Mr. Nemetz having made such a statement.</mark>

A full transcript of the February 16, 2016 episode of _Nancy Grace_ is at Appendix B. The
portions of the episode devoted to _State v. Nemetz_ follow, with PA Lindquist’s comments in
boldface.

<ul>GRACE: Good evening. I’m Nancy Grace. I want to thank you for being with
us.

Bombshell tonight. Friends, family, relatives in shock after husband Skylar
Nemetz walks free.<sup>4</sup> Police hone in on Nemetz when his young wife, Danielle, is
found still seated at her home computer but shot dead in the back of the head,
blowing off her face.

Police say a neighbor had bought Danielle alcohol at her request. He stopped by
the liquor store while Nemetz [was] away on military training. And when he
found out the neighbor had done that favor, it infuriated Nemetz so much, he was
to the point he was, quote, “shaking with anger.”

Straight out to Candace Trunzo, senior editor, Dailymail.com. Candace Trunzo, I
know that this episode apparently infuriated Nemetz, the husband. He was away
for about two weeks on some military training op. And he was the one that told
his wife to go to the liquor store and have it there when he got home. He had
been dry for two weeks. He wanted X, whatever liquor -- oh, it was, like,
cinnamon vodka or . . .

CANDACE TRUNZO, DAILYMAIL.COM (via telephone): Cinnamon whiskey,
yes.

GRACE: Whiskey, that‘s right, cinnamon whiskey. I never heard of it. It‘s got,
like, a devil on the side with a pitchfork. But long story short, he asked her to go
get the liquor. And she then mentions it to a neighbor, who st0ps by the liquor
store, brings it, drops it at the house. And he gets furious. But I don‘t see that as
enough of a motive. So what I want to talk about, Candace Trunzo, is the
physical evidence. I want to start with the physical evidence. What do we know,
Candace?

TRUNZO: Well, we know that when the police arrived, they found her sitting at
her computer. She was shot through her left eye. She was shot in the back with an
AR-l 5 assault weapon, through the back, went through the eye, into the computer.

GRACE: Wait, wait, wait! Did you say an assault weapon?

TRUNZO: Yes. An AR-15 assault weapon.</ul>

<hr>

<sup>4</sup> Mr. Nemetz was released on bond on or about October 31, 2014.

# See Lindquist broadcast statements

<ul>GRACE: Guys, I‘m being joined right now -- hold on, Candace Trunzo from
Dailymail.com. In my ear, I‘m hearing we have special guest joining us, Mark
Lindquist, the Pierce County elected prosecutor. Mark, thank you so much for
being with us.

**MARK LINDQUIST, PIERCE COUNTY PROSECUTOR (via telephone):
Thank you, Nancy.**

GRACE: Mark, I know that you are on a break from court, so I want to ask you a
couple of quick questions. I know all about the amendment to the Constitution
that gives us the right to bear arms. I‘m tine with bearing arms. But an assault
weapon at home? Why did he have an assault weapon at home, Mark?

**LINDQUIST: The defendant was highly experienced with firearms. He
actually had 15 different weapons in his apartment. He‘d been handling guns
since he was 4 years old. He actually builds AR-lSs. He buys the parts and
puts them together. And he customized the weapon in this case for Danielle.
So . . .**

GRACE: Wait, what does that mean? I think I know my way around a weapon
from being a prosecutor for so many years, but what do you mean he customized
an AR -- an assault weapon for his wife?

**LINDQUIST: He put together the parts and he balanced the weapon in a
way that it would be ambidextrous,'so it could be used on either shoulder.**

GRACE: You‘re seeing the scene of the shooting. We‘ve heard everything from
an accident to she was the one holding the weapon, to a mistake. I’m trying to get
a line on what exactly the defense is going to be. And there you see Danielle
Nemetz and Skylar in their happy times. And as a matter of fact, it was stated in
evidence that there had been no argument leading up to the shooting. But it’s
only him and her in the room, isn‘t that right, Mark Lindquist?

**LINDQUIST: Right. But we can look at what happened before they were
alone together in the room. Initially, as you pointed out, the defendant said
Danielle shot herself. Later he said that he shot her accidentally. And now
at trial, he‘s saying that he doesn’t remember pulling the trigger.**

GRACE: You know what? You just brought up something really interesting,
Mark Lindquist. I‘m just getting it straight out of the courtroom. Listen to this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Skylar, did you point the weapon at your wife?

SKYLAR NEMETZ, CHARGED WITH MURDER: No, I didn’t!
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you intend to hurt your wife?

NEMETZ: I did not! I did not intend to hurt my wife. I never did. I wanted her
to be with me forever! I wanted her to be the mother of my child.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GRACE: OK, straight to you, Ryan Schwartz, defense attorney out of the Atlanta
jurisdiction. Why is he crying now? Because from what I understand, the day of
the shooting, Ryan Schwartz, he wasn’t crying. After his wife accidentally shot
herself in the head as she was sitting at her home computer, it’s my understanding
he actually kicked some evidence under the bed and hid some other evidence.
But in court, it’s, Wah, wah.

RYAN SCHWARTZ, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, again, Nancy, this is an
accident. Accidents happen every day. He‘s obviously upset because he didn’t
intend to kill his wife.

GRACE: OK, you know what? I hear you. I hear you. But I want to analyze
what this guy says on the stand again. Oh, yes, he‘s crying now! Run it again,
Liz.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Skylar, did you point the weapon at your wife?

NEMETZ: NO, I didn’t!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you intend to hurt your wife?

NEMETZ: I did not! I did not intend to hurt my wife. I never did. I wanted her
to be with me forever! I wanted her to be the mother of my child.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GRACE: Mark Lindquist joining me, the elected prosecutor in Pierce County.

Mark, has he been crying like that the whole time?

**LINDQUIST: No, he hasn’t. But -- and as you know, Nancy, prosecutors
don‘t have to prove motive, but jurors always want to know the motive,
right? And the motive in this case was jealousy. The evidence suggests the
defendant thought Danielle was fooling around with another soldier. Even if
that‘s not true, the point is the defendant suspected that.**

GRACE: Unleash the lawyers. Joining me out of Atlanta, Ryan Schwartz, and
out of New York, family law attorney and victims’ rights advocate, Susan Moss.
Susan Moss, did you see him turning on those waterworks? You know, he wasn‘t
crying that day.

SUSAN MOSS, VICTIMS‘ RIGHTS ATTORNEY: No, I actually didn’t see any
tears at all. Apparently, he didn‘t go to the Jodi Arias school of learning how to
cry! But domestic violence is violence, and domestic violence that leads to
murder is murder! More women die at the hands of their partner than any other
disease or any other reason! The fact here is that this was a man who was intense
on control! And when he thought that his wife was receiving gifts, in this case
alcohol from the neighbor, that‘s when he went crazy! That‘s what happened in
this case, and that‘s what I believe they’ll prove!

GRACE: But isn‘t it true, Candace Trunzo, senior news editor, Dailymail.com,
he‘s the one that asked for the liquor? He started the whole thing.

TRUNZO: He did. He was texting -- I mean, he couldn’t wait to get his hands on
that bottle of cinnamon whiskey. He was texting her, Please get me the whiskey,
please get me the whiskey. And for whatever reason, she didn‘t get it. She got a
neighbor get it, and the neighbor was a man. The neighbor was a man, and he
suspected something was going on between this man and Danielle, that she was
cheating on him.

GRACE: With me right now, renowned forensic pathologist Dr. William Morrone
joining me out of Madison Heights. Dr. Morrone, thank you for being with us.
It’s my contention, and I think the district attorney agrees with me -- I‘ve got him
right here with me, Mark Lindquist -- Dr. Morrone, this is absolutely impossible
to have been self-inflicted. Yes, no.

DR. WILLIAM MORRONE, FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST: Absolutely. You
can’t shoot yourself in the back of the head with a rifle. Absolutely.

GRACE: Now, why do you say that?

MORRONE: Well, it‘s going to take holding it in such a way that you can pull the
trigger, and you can‘t put that far enough behind you even with a short barrel.
And this is a small, petite woman, and the legal distance between the chamber and
the tip of the barrel is mandated by the state, and that has to be certain distance.
She would have had to have been reaching three feet behind her head . . .

GRACE: Ridiculous!

MORRONE: . . . to get to the trigger to shoot herself in the head so it would come
out the eye. And that round is going over a thousand feet a second. That‘s why it
penetrates bone twice.

GRACE: Joining us on a break is Mark Lindquist, the Pierce County elected
prosecutor. Again, Mr. Lindquist, thank you for being with us, joining us out of
Tacoma. Mark, I want to look at the facts. I mean, as you said, the state doesn‘t
have to prove motive, although the jury likes to think they know the motive
because it helps them put together the puzzle, like we all want to do.

**LINDQUIST: Right.**

GRACE: But what you’ve got to rely on, as you accurately pointed out, is the
hard forensics. What can you tell me about what was found in that room? How
do we know she had been sitting at her computer at the time she was shot in the
head?

**LINDQUIST: There‘s really no dispute that she was sitting at the computer
when she was shot in the head. And at this point in the trial, the defense is
arguing not that she shot herself, but rather that it was an accident. That’s
the whole defense. And that’s the whole question. Was this an accident? Was
it intentional? And that’s why the defendant‘s experience with firearms is
critical to the case. But it‘s not just that physical evidence, it’s the behavior
afterwards.**

GRACE: Right.

**LINDQUIST: The defendant never called 911. He never called for help. He
seemed more focused on cleaning up the scene, disposing of the liquor bottles**

GRACE: Oh!

**LINDQUIST: . . . than getting help. And it’s his actions combined with his
statements . . .**

GRACE: Behavioral evidence.

**LINDQUIST: . . . and his experience with firearms that add up to murder,
rather than an accident.**

the back of the head with an AR-lS, he made up several stories.

NEMETZ: I did not intend to hurt my wife! I never did!

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GRACE: There you see Skylar Nemetz on the stand defending himself and claims
that he, in cold blood, shot down his young wife. Apparently, motive, he had
been away for about two weeks on a training op with the military and demanded
over and over, texting and calling, that she have a certain kind of liquor at the
house when he got home. Well, a neighbor stopped by the liquor store and got it
for her, and when he found out this neighbor was actually a man, he allegedly
goes berserk to the point that he was actually shaking. With me right now, special
guest, in addition to Mark Lindquist, the elected prosecutor in that jurisdiction,
James Peltier, friend and neighbor of the victim, Danielle Nemetz. James, thank
you for being with us.

JAMES PELTIER, FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR (via telephone): Thank you,
Nancy.

GRACE: I‘m just so stunned that this situation escalated to the point where she is
gunned down dead sitting at her home computer. What can you tell us about their
relationship? What did you ever observe?

PELTIER: Well, there was some red flags on one occasion that really stood out to
us the last time she came down to Humboldt County to visit us, and he was
fighting with her and ended up smashing her cell phone to the ground. And I had
conversations with Danielle. He just basically dumped her at our house, didn‘t
even come in and say hi or anything. And I talked to Danielle and asked her if
she was afraid of him or in fear, and her response was, Only when he‘s been
drinking.

GRACE: “Only when he‘s been drinking.” Everybody, that‘s home video of
Danielle from YouTube. Let‘s listen to it.

DANIELLE NEMETZ, VICTIM: I‘m so excited! OK, is there a card? OK.
Read your card first. I’m so excited! OK.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GRACE: There you see Danielle apparently reading a gift and a card from her
husband, clearly deeply, deeply in love with him. I want to go through the
physical evidence. Matt Zarrell, I want to walk through the blood evidence and
why we know his story is a lie. But first, listen to him. We just got this from the
courtroom.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

NEMETZ: And I was trying to clear the weapon, and I didn‘t do it correctly and I
made a terrible mistake. And the weapon went off in my hands and it struck the
back of my wife. It hit her in the head. And she died.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GRACE: Christopher Robinson, firearms expert with Chris Robinson Forensics,
former crime lab director out of Orlando -- Chris, that is a crock of BS, what I just
heard. I’m not a gun expert like you, but I know that, what he just said, is a lie. I
mean, really? I was cleaning my shotgun? How old is that?

CHRIS ROBINSON, FIREARMS EXPERT (via telephone): Absolutely, Nancy.
The first rule of any gun is to keep it pointed in a safe direction. So it‘s pointed at
the back of her head, when he‘s supposedly trying to clear the weapon. Well,
why is his finger on the trigger of the weapon? When you‘re trying to clear the
weapon, you just pull the bolt to the rear and eject the cartridge case. So why
would he be having his finger on the trigger? He had to fire the weapon, so he
had to pull the trigger.

GRACE: Matt, what do we know about the blood evidence and the physical
evidence at the scene?

MATT ZARRELL, NANCY GRACE PRODUCER (via telephone): OK, so when
officers found Danielle, she was in a chair at the computer, with her head slumped
forward and a pool of blood at her feet. The bullet actually went through the
computer screen she was facing. C0ps also discovered that there was a magazine
under the bed. The AR-lS was in the closet. The cinnamon whiskey was flushed
down the toilet, and the liquor bottles were thrown into some brush underneath
the apartment building.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Prosecutors claim Nemetz became enraged after
learning another man bought his wife liquor.

911 OPERATOR: (INAUDIBLE) shot her?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don‘t know that part. We just heard the gun go off,
and he said there was an accident.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nemetz contends the shooting was an accident.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

GRACE: For those of you just joining us, a young wife found dead, clearly sitting
at her own home computer when she‘s shot in the head. Now, theories abound as
to what really happened, but her husband, the only one at home at the time of the
shooting beside her -- and they had been very happy up until this point, by all
accounts -- was that first, she did it herself. Second, it was an accident, that he
was cleaning his gun, and third, a variation on accident. Can those stories all be
true? Well, not according to the physical evidence. But look at what we‘re
hearing in court right now.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The woman that means the rest of your life to ~- you
didn‘t go to her aid, did you.

NEMETZ: No, I did not.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Plus (ph) says that you were shaking with anger
because he told you someone else got the alcohol.

NEMETZ: That did not happen, sir.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GRACE: Straight out to Dr. Daniel Bober, forensic psychiatrist joining me out of
Miami. Dr. Bober, it’s too difficult for me to believe this guy. He’s told several
stories. Now he’s saying he was not shaking with anger. According to one
witness, he was. What do you make of it? Now, you‘ve heard from the friend,
joining us today, James Peltier, that said the wife said, I was never afraid of him
except when he was drinking.

DANIEL BOBER, FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST: Nancy, there are a lot of
aspects of this story that are very troubling -- the multiple versions that he told
about how she died, the attempts to conceal evidence after the crime. We’re
never really going to know what happened leading up to the moments before her
death. But certainly, there is a motive there. And a lot of times it’s when people
are saying that they weren’t thinking what they were doing that they were doing
what they were thinking. So I think that he was desperate and he was scared at
the last minute and he probably knew that he was going to get caught, and so he
attempted to sanitize the scene, if you will. But it just doesn‘t really add up. His
version just doesn‘t make sense.

GRACE: The changing stories. Unleash the lawyers, Sue Moss out of New York,
Ryan Schwartz out of Atlanta, Danny Cevallos joining us out of Philadelphia.
First to you, Danny Cevallos. Why didn‘t he call 911? If this were an accident, as
he‘s saying, cleaning his assault rifle, then why didn‘t he call 911?

DANNY CEVALLOS, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: He‘s got a lot of things to
explain away. But I think the difference between not calling 911 and bringing in
all this evidence that maybe they had arguments and maybe they didn‘t get along -
- you see this all the time in murder cases, and it really is unfair to demonstrate
that somebody maybe didn‘t get along with his wife, and therefore, that‘s the
reason he may not have been cleaning his guns by accident.

GRACE: What‘s unfair about that?

CEVALLOS: Still it doesn‘t change the fact -- it‘s unfair because it goes -- you
know as well as I do, Nancy, that yes, it’s admissible . . .

GRACE: Well, first of all...

CEVALLOS: . . . but it‘s really about . . .

GRACE: . . . don‘t tell me what. . .

CEVALLOS: It‘s tainting the jury.

GRACE: . . . I know or don‘t know, number one. I don‘t need you . . .
CEVALLOS: Well, I‘m pretty sure you know that, Nancy.

GRACE: . . . to school me in the law, but thank you. And I‘m asking you a direct
question. Are you saying it‘s unfair that behavioral evidence comes in before the
jury?

CEVALLOS: It’s -- look, we‘ve decided as a society that it‘s admissible, but it is
problematic because you‘d be hard-pressed to find a marriage that doesn‘t have
some disagreement, some strife. And to use that to demonstrate to a jury that
that‘s why somebody really wasn‘t cleaning his gun by accident seems a little
unfair. But to be frank . . .

GRACE: Well, of course, the question that I asked you . . .
CEVALLOS: . . . we have another rule, so . . .

GRACE: . . . was why. ..

CEVALLOS: . . . what can I tell you.

GRACE: . . . didn’t he call 911. That was the question. And to Mark Lindquist
joining us, the elected prosecutor in Pierce County there in Tacoma. Mark, the
reality is, it’s highly, highly probative when you are at home, you’re the only
other person in the home, and you were in the middle of a fast and furious fight
with your wife over something that has just happened. I think it’s highly
probative.

**LINDQUIST: Right. And the jury wants to know what happened before the
shooting and after the shooting because it helps them appraise the
defendant‘s mental state. What was he doing and why?**

GRACE: Candace Trunzo, senior news editor, Dailymail.com, do you really think
a jury is going to buy all this waterworks in the courtroom, the crying, the
snotting, the sniveling? And he only does that at certain points, for instance, when
he‘s asked a tough question that he doesn‘t want to answer.

TRUNZO: Well, it‘s true, but you know, this guy -- he has no record. He has
nothing to blemish, you know, a military man, nothing, nothing to take away from
the fact that he was an upstanding citizen and a good soldier. So I think the jury
could be possibly swayed by this. But what would drive him to shoot this
wonderful young wife that he seemed to love? Anybody‘s guess.

GRACE: OK, are these real or are these crocodile tears?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Skylar, did you point the weapon at your wife?

NEMETZ: No, I didn’t!
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you intend to hurt your wife?

NEMETZ: I did not! I did not intend to hurt my wife. I never did. I wanted her
to be with me forever! I wanted her to be the mother of my child.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</ul>

The episode was broadcast nationally on February 16, 2016, the same day that PA Lindquist’s
interview was recorded. Immediately after the broadcast, Mr. Stewart learned of it through Mr.
Nemetz’s mother. He watched a recording of it later that day. <mark>He was amazed by the conduct of
PA Lindquist, whom he had considered a friend, and he was very concerned that members of the
jury could have seen or heard about the interview.</mark>

The next day, February 17, 2016, <mark>Mr. Stewart sent an email to Judge Nevin</mark>, DPA Greer, and
DPA Ausserer to which were attached clips of PA Lindquist’s interview on _Nancy Grace_:

<ul>Nancy Grace conducted a show on our case/trial. A member of the prosecutor’s
office participated.

<mark>It was aired on live national television during a time when jurors were released
and available to potentially watch tv, unlike if it aired while we were in court. I
politely declined to participate as the trial was on-going.</mark></ul>

<mark>Judge Nevin had seen the broadcast himself while on vacation in Arizona.</mark> He was working out
at a gym when _Nancy Grace_ happened to come on a nearby television, and he saw Mr. Nemetz
on the screen. The sound was turned down, so he did not hear the dialogue. But <mark>he immediately
became concerned that the show, and PA Lindquist’s appearance on it, could prejudice the
proceeding.</mark> Before leaving for Arizona, he had arranged to communicate by email with counsel
in case any issues arose during the recess. The morning after PA Lindquist’s interview was
broadcast nationally on _Nancy Grace_, Judge Nevin received and replied to Mr. Stewart’s email
as follows:

<ul>I am aware of the telecast you referenced.</ul>

# See The Motion for Mistrial

The trial resumed on February 22, 2016. On that date, Mr. Stewart <mark>filed a Motion to Declare
Mistrial and Award Attorney Fees based on PA Lindquist’s appearance on _Nancy Grace_.</mark> Before
the State’s rebuttal witness began his testimony, Judge Nevin reminded the members of the jury
that they should inform his judicial assistant if they had “any exposure whatsoever, directly or
indirectly, to anything about this case that's been in any form of media, print, broadcast, telecast,
analog, [or] digital . . . .” None of the jurors told Judge Nevin’s judicial assistant they had had
any such exposure.

Immediately after the State’s rebuttal witness testified, Judge Nevin held a hearing on the motion
for mistrial. Mr. Stewart argued the motion on Mr. Nemetz’s behalf, and DPA Greer argued for
the State. DPA Greer argued that there was no cause for a mistrial in the absence of any
evidence that one or more jurors viewed PA Lindquist’s appearance on _Nancy Grace_. He added:

<ul><mark>Then you have a colorable ethics violation that defense can make, I would
presume, to the bar association.</mark> To the extent that a Superior Court Judge gets
involved, because it does involve an ongoing case, I’m sure that’s part of what
Mr. Stewart is arguing here when he asks for sanctions, etcetera, and I’m not here
to speak to Mr. Lindquist’s motives, what specifically his mindset was when he
spoke. I think only he can factually answer those questions if they need to be
answered. It speaks for itself to some extent. Those were decisions he made and
they were independent of Mr. Ausserer and I. And so, <mark>factually, that resides with
him</mark>. How can I stand up here and defend something I'm not aware of in the sense
of what he said, why he said, what he said, whether he believes this is defensible,
justifiable, allowable, those kinds of things. I’m not his attorney. And it is my
case, but I’m representing the State, there is a tangential effect on it, obviously,
and to the extent that anybody in our office acts in any manner outside or touches
on the rules of ethics, we’re, what’s the word, it attaches to us.</ul>

Judge Nevin took the matter under consideration and, after a recess, denied the motion for
mistrial. Judge Nevin ruled that there was no basis for a mistrial because there was no evidence
that any of the jurors had seen or heard the _Nancy Grace_ episode about _State v. Nemetz_. Judge
Nevin added that <mark>the propriety of PA Lindquist’s comments on the show was not before the
court,</mark> since there was no evidence that any juror had heard them.

Closing arguments began the next day, and the jury began deliberating a day later, on February
24, 2016. After seven days of deliberation, the jury reached a verdict on March 3, 2016. The
jury <mark>did not reach a verdict on the crime of murder in the first degree or the first lesser included
crime of murder in the second degree</mark>, but found Mr. Nemetz guilty of the second lesser included
crime of manslaughter in the first degree. On March 25, 2016, Mr. Nemetz was sentenced to 162
months of confinement. Mr. Nemetz appealed, but he did not make any argument on appeal
concerning the motion for mistrial or any other argument which, if successful, would result in a
retrial on the original charge of murder in the first degree.

# See VIOLATION ANALYSIS

**RPC 3.6**

<mark>Preserving the right to a fair trial necessarily entails some limits on the extrajudicial statements
that a lawyer may make about a case or a party.</mark> RPC 3.6 cmt. [1]. “The theory of our system is
that the conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence and argument in
open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public print.” Patterson
v. Colorado, 205 US. 454, 462, 27 S. Ct. 556, 51 L. Ed. 879 (1907) (Holmes, I.) If Justice
Holmes had lived a century later, he might have added tabloid television to the list. Extrajudicial
statements by prosecuting attorneys are more likely than those by other lawyers to affect a
party’s right to an impartial jury and a fair trial, because a prosecuting attorney speaks with “the
inherent authority of the government.” Attorney Grievance Commission v. Gansler, 377 Md.
656, 835 A.2d 548, 559 (2003).

RPC 3.6 (Trial Publicity) <mark>limits the extrajudicial statements that any lawyer, including a
prosecuting attorney, may make about a civil or criminal case.</mark> RPC 3.6 must be read in
conjunction with the comments to the rule and the Guidelines for Applying Rule 3.6
(“Guidelines”), as well as RPC 3.8(f). RPC 3.6 cmt. [8-9].

RPC 3.6(a) sets forth a general prohibition against making statements that a lawyer <mark>knows or
should know will have a “substantial likelihood” of materially prejudicing an adjudicative
proceeding.</mark> RPC 3.6 cmt. [3]. RPC 3.6(a) provides:

<ul>A lawyer who is participating or has participated in the investigation or litigation
of a matter <mark>shall not make</mark> an extrajudicial statement that the lawyer knows or
reasonably should know <mark>will be disseminated by means of public communication
and will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative
proceeding in the matter.</mark></ul>

One relevant factor in determining whether an extrajudicial statement will have a “substantial
likelihood” of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding is the nature of the proceeding.
RPC 3.6 cmt. [6]. <mark>“Criminal jury trials will be most sensitive to extrajudicial speech.” 1;
Another relevant factor is the timing of the statement. Broadcasting extrajudicial statements
during trial “greatly magnifies the risk that a jury will be tainted by undue extrajudicial
influences.”</mark> _State v. Polk_, 415 S.W.3d 692, 696 (Mo. Ct. App. 2013).

RPC 3.6(b) provides a “safe harbor” provision that allows a lawyer to make certain types of
statements notwithstanding the general prohibition set forth in RPC 3.6(a). SQ In re Brizzi, 962
N.E.2d 1240, 1248-49 (2012); Gansler, 835 A.2d at 563.<sup>5</sup> RPC 3.6(b) provides:

<ul>Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a lawyer may state:

(1) the claim, offense or defense involved and, except when prohibited by law,
the identity of the persons involved;

(2) information contained in a public record;

(3) that an investigation of a matter is in progress;

(4) the scheduling or result of any step in litigation;

(5) a request for assistance in obtaining evidence and information necessary
thereto;

(6) a warning of danger concerning the behavior of a person involved, when
there is reason to believe that there exists the likelihood of substantial harm to an
individual or to the public interest; and

(7) in a criminal case, in addition to subparagraphs (1) through (6):

(i) the identity, residence, occupation and family status of the accused;

(ii) if the accused has not been apprehended, information necessary to aid in
apprehension of the person;

(iii) the fact, time and place of arrest; and

(iv) the identity of investigating and arresting officers or agencies and the
length of the investigation.</ul>
 
<hr>

<sup>5</sup> Gansler, 835 A.2d at 562-63, discusses an earlier version of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct
(MRCP) in which the safe harbor provision was in MRPC 3.6(c).

# See Safe Harbor provisions

These types of statements “should not in any event be considered prohibited by the general
prohibition of [RPC 3.6(a)].” RPC 3.6 cmt. [4]. Of particular relevance to this case is the safe
harbor for “information contained in a public record,” RPC 3.6(b)(2). The Guidelines also
reiterate some of the safe harbor provisions of RPC 3.6(b), providing, inter alia, that a lawyer
involved in the litigation of a criminal case “may state without elaboration . . . [t]he information
contained in the public record.” Guidelines, § I.B.(2).

On the other hand, there are certain types of statements that are “more likely than not to have a
material prejudicial effect on a proceeding,” particularly when they refer to a criminal case. RPC
3.6 cmt. [5]. These are:

<ul>(l) the character, credibility, reputation or criminal record of a party, suspect in
a criminal investigation or witness, or the identity of a witness, or the expected
testimony of a party or witness;

(2) in a criminal case or proceeding that could result in incarceration, the
possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense or the existence or contents of any
confession, admission, or statement given by a defendant or suspect or that
person's refusal or failure to make a statement;

(3) the performance or results of any examination or test or the refusal or
failure of a person to submit to an examination or test, or the identity or nature of
physical evidence expected to be presented;

(4) any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of a defendant or suspect in a
criminal case or proceeding that could result in incarceration;

(5) information that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is likely to
be inadmissible as evidence in a trial and that would, if disclosed, create a
substantial risk of prejudicing an impartial trial; or

(6) the fact that a defendant has been charged with a crime, unless there is
included therein a statement explaining that the charge is merely an accusation
and that the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.</ul>

RPC 3.6 cmt. [5]; Guidelines, § LA. Because of this, such statements are rebuttably presumed to
have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding. Brizzi, 962
N.E.2d at 1245-46; see also Board of Professional Responsibility, Wyoming State Bar v. Murray,
143 P.3d 353, 356 (2006) (extrajudicial statements expressing opinion as to guilt of criminal
defendant presumptively improper). Of particular relevance to this case are the provisions
concerning (1) the credibility of a party or witness and (4) any opinion as to the guilt or
innocence of a defendant.

**RPC 3.8(f)**

RPC 3.6 applies to all lawyers, not just prosecuting attorneys, although the <mark>extrajudicial
statements of prosecuting attorneys pose a heightened risk of materially prejudicing an
adjudicative proceeding.</mark> RPC 3.6(a); Brizzi, 962 N.E.2d at 1246; Gansler, 835 A.2d at 559. But
unlike other lawyers, “[a] prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice and not simply
that of an advocate.” RPC 3.8 cmt. [1]. In addition to the risk of materially prejudicing an
adjudicative proceeding, “a prosecutor's extrajudicial statement can create the additional problem
of increasing public condemnation of the accused.” RPC 3.8 cmt. [5]. To address this problem,
RPC 3.8(f) places <mark>additional limits</mark> on the extrajudicial statements that a prosecuting attorney
may make about a criminal case. RPC 3.8(f) provides that “except for statements that are
necessary to inform the public of the nature and extent of the prosecutor's action and that serve a
legitimate law enforcement purpose,”

<ul>The prosecutor in a criminal case shall . . . refrain from making extrajudicial
comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation
of the accused and exercise reasonable care to prevent investigators, law
enforcement personnel, employees or other persons assisting or associated with
the prosecutor in a criminal case from making an extrajudicial statement that the
prosecutor would be prohibited from making under Rule 3.6 or this Rule.</ul>

The explanatory comment to RPC 3.8(f) provides that nothing in the comment is intended to
restrict statements that comply with the safe harbor provisions of RPC 3.6(b). RPC 3.8 cmt. [5].

# See Application to PA Lindquist’s Extrajudicial Statements

In his response to the grievance, PA Lindquist states (through counsel) that his statements on
Nancy Grace complied with RPC 3.6 and 3.8(f) because each statement “had its source in the
public record.” Some of the statements PA Lindquist made during his two interviews on Nancy
Grace did convey, more or less “without elaboration,” information contained in the Declaration
for Determination of Probable Cause. Guidelines, § I.B.(2). Some of PA Lindquist’s statements
about Mr. Nemetz’s experience with firearms and the statements Mr. Nemetz made about the
shooting fall into this category. The Declaration for Determination of Probable Cause is a
“public record,” so these statements fall within the safe harbor of RPC 3.6(b)(2) insofar as they
do not go beyond quotations from or references to the contents of that public record. RPC 3.6
cmt. [4]; Guidelines, § I.B.(2); Brizzi, 962 NE. 2d at 1247; Gansler, 835 A.2d at 569.

<mark>But many of PA Lindquist’s statements go well beyond “information contained in a public
record” and do not fall within any of the safe harbor provisions</mark> of RPC 3.6(b). For example:

<ul><li> In his first _Nancy Grace_ interview, PA Lindquist stated that Mr. Nemetz “gave basically
three different stories, which obviously undercuts his claim that this was an accident.”
That Mr. Nemetz gave three different stories may be “information contained in a public
record,” RPC 3.6(b)(2), but whether that “undercuts his claim that this was an accident”
is clearly PA Lindquist’s own opinion about the evidence, as well as a statement about
Mr. Nemetz’s credibility.
<li> In his first _Nancy Grace_ interview, PA Lindquist stated that Mr. Nemetz “may have
imagined that she was doing something, cheating on him, to me that just gives him
motive to murder her.” He added, “I don’t think there’s a jury out there that will say,
maybe she was cheating and therefore this is manslaughter. On the contrary, they will say
that’s motive for murder.” PA Lindquist’s opinions about what Mr. Nemetz “may have
imagined” or about what “gives him motive to murder her” are just that: PA Lindquist’s
Opinions, not “information contained in a public record.” The same is true of PA
Lindquist’s prognostications about what a jury “will say.” The clear import of that
statement is, moreover, that a jury not only will say but should say “that’s motive for
murder.”
<li> In his first _Nancy Grace_ interview, PA Lindquist stated that Mr. Nemetz’s “claims that it
was an accident just don’t make sense.” What Mr. Nemetz’s claims are may be
“information contained in a public record,” but the assertion that those claims “don’t
make sense” is PA Lindquist’s own Opinion about the evidence and a statement about Mr.
Nemetz’s credibility.
<li> In his first _Nancy Grace_ interview, PA Lindquist stated, “I think the motive of jealousy
makes it more clear that this was intentional.” What PA Lindquist may think about Mr.
Nemetz’s motive and intent is his Opinion, not “information contained in a public
record.” It is, moreover his opinion about what he himself would say, in his second
Nancy Grace interview, was the ultimate issue to be determined: “That’s the whole
defense. And that’s the whole question. Was this an accident? Was it intentional?”
<li> In his second _Nancy Grace_ interview, PA Lindquist reiterated his Opinion about Mr.
Nemetz’s motive, and editorialized about what, in his view, the evidence “suggests:”
“And the motive in this case was jealousy. The evidence suggests the defendant thought
Danielle was fooling around with another soldier. Even if that’s not true, the point is the
defendant suspected that.” Some of the evidence may be “information contained in a
public record,” but what that evidence “suggests” and the inferences to be drawn from it
are not.
<li> In his second _Nancy Grace_ interview, PA Lindquist also expressed his evaluation of
certain evidence, as well as certain putative facts that were not in evidence. He opined,
for example, that “the defendant’s experience with firearms is critical to the case.” And
even though there was no evidence of a fight immediately before the shooting, PA
Lindquist agreed with Nancy Grace that “it’s highly, highly probative when you are at
home, you’re the only other person in the home, and you were in the middle of a fast and
furious fight with your wife over something that has just happened.”
<li> Finally, in his second _Nancy Grace_ interview, PA Lindquist framed what in his view was
“the whole question” to be answered by the jury, and then summed up his own answer to
that question: “And that’s the whole question. Was this an accident? Was it intentional?”
“And it’s his actions combined with his statements . . . and his eXperience with firearms
that add up to murder, rather than an accident.” PA Lindquist’s summing up of the
evidence and his opinion on the ultimate issue of fact are not “information contained in a
public record.” They are his personal assessment of the evidence and his opinion as to
the guilt or innocence of the defendant.</ul>

<mark>Because these statements do not fall within any of the safe harbor provisions of RPC 3.6(b), it
must be determined whether they had a “substantial likelihood” of materially prejudicing an
adjudicative proceeding or of heightening public condemnation of the accused when made by the
elected Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney on a nationally broadcast tabloid television show
before and during a criminal jury trial. It is not determinative of this question that Judge Nevin
found no evidence that any juror had actually viewed the _Nancy Grace_ episode</mark> about _State v.
Nemetz_, because RPC 3.6 and RPC 3.8(f) do not require that an extrajudicial statement cause
actual prejudice to a criminal defendant or a proceeding. Brizzi, 962 N.E.2d at 1245. In
determining the likelihood of prejudice from a prosecuting attorney’s extrajudicial statements,
the statements must be viewed in the context in which they are made at the time they are made,
not in hindsight. Q; Gansler, 835 A.2d at 571. 

<mark>Many of PA Lindquist’s statements on _Nancy Grace_ fall into the categories of statements that are
“more likely than not to have a material prejudicial effect on a proceeding,”</mark> particularly when
they refer to a criminal case. RPC 3.6 cmt. [5]. Statements in these categories are rebuttably
presumed to have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing a proceeding. Brizzi, 962
N.E.2d at 1245-46. Among them are PA Lindquist’s statements about Mr. Nemetz’s credibility,
such as the statement that Mr. Nemetz’s “claims that it was an accident just don’t make sense”
and the statement that certain evidence “undercuts his claim that this was an accident.” SQ RPC
3.6 cmt. [5](1); Guidelines, § I.A.(1). Still more troubling are statements that amount to PA
Lindquist’s opinion as to Mr. Nemetz’s guilt or innocence, such as the statement, “I think the
motive of jealousy makes it more clear that this was intentional,” and the statement that “it’s his
actions combined with his statements . . . and his experience with firearms that add up to murder,
rather than an accident.” E RPC 3.6 cmt. [5](4); Guidelines, § I.A.(4). A prosecuting
attomey’s Opinion of guilt is especially likely to create prejudice, since his words carry the
authority of the government and are eSpecially persuasive in the public’s eye. Brizzi, 962 N.E.2d
at 1246; Gansler, 835 A.2d at 572.

Other considerations in determining whether PA Lindquist’s extrajudicial statements had a
“substantial likelihood” of materially prejudicing a proceeding or heightening public
condemnation of the accused include the nature of the proceeding and the context and timing of
the statements. The proceeding at issue here is a criminal jury trial, and criminal jury trials are
the “most sensitive to extrajudicial speech.” RPC 3.6 cmt. [6]. The statements were made on a
nationally broadcast television show, which even the trial judge happened to see by chance. That
particular show was notorious for its sensationalism and its “one-sided view” of the stories it
covered, and by appearing on it PA Lindquist lent it his “inherent authority” as the elected Pierce
County Prosecuting Attorney. “Nancy Grace to Leave HLN After More Than a Decade,” Ni”.
York Times, June 30, 2016; Gansler, 835 A.2d at 559, 572. Finally, <mark>allowing those statements to
be broadcast while the trial was in recess and just days before the jury began its deliberations
greatly magnified the risk of materially prejudicing the proceeding.</mark> 1%, 415 S.W.3d at 696.

Given the nature of PA Lindquist’s extrajudicial statements, the nature of the proceeding, and the
context and timing of the statements, it appears that <mark>PA Lindquist may have violated RPC 3.6
and RPC 3.8(f). It also appears that PA Lindquist may have violated RPC 8.4(d), which
prohibits “conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.”</mark> Conduct prejudicial to the
administration of justice includes violations of accepted practice norms. In re Disciplinary
Proceeding Against Longacre, 155 Wn.2d 723, 741-42, 122 P.3d 710 (2005). Accordingly, we
will be forwarding this matter to a Review Committee with our recommendation that a hearing
should be ordered under ELC 5.7(d)(5). The Review Committee has wide discretion, and may
dismiss the grievance, dismiss with an advisory letter, issue an admonition, or order the matter to
a hearing for a public determination of the violations and the apprOpriate disciplinary sanction.
ELC 5.7(d).

# See SANCTION ANALYSIS

The Washington Supreme Court has held that the American Bar Association Standards for
Imposing Lamer Sanctions (1991 ed. & Feb. 1992 Supp.) (“ABA Standards”) provide the
appropriate framework to impose disciplinary sanctions. In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against
Halverson, 140 Wn.2d 475, 492, 998 P.2d 833 (2000); In re Disciplinm Proceeding Against
Johnson, 114 Wn.2d 737, 745, 790 P.2d 1227 (1990). The ABA Standards require examination
of (l) the duty violated, (2) the lawyer’s mental state, (3) the extent of actual or potential injury
caused by the lawyer’s conduct, and (4) aggravating and mitigating factors. The nature of the
duty violated together with the lawyer’s mental state and any actual or potential injury determine
the presumptive sanction to be applied.

ABA Standards std. 5.2 applies to government lawyers who violate RPC 3.6 or 3.8(f), or engage
in conduct that is otherwise prejudicial to the administration of justice. See, e.g., Murray, 143
P.3d at 357; American Bar Association Annotated Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions
271-285 (2015). Under ABA Standards std. 5.22, suspension is the presumptive sanction “when
a lawyer in an official or governmental position knowingly fails to follow proper procedures or
rules, and causes injury or potential injury to a party or to the integrity of the legal process.”
“Knowingly” means having “conscious awareness of the nature or attendant circumstances of the
conduct,” not conscious awareness that the conduct violates the RPC. In re Disciplina_ry
Proceeding Against Egger, 152 Wn.2d 393, 415-16, 98 P.3d 477 (2004) (citing ABA Standards,
Definitions).

In this case, it appears that PA Lindquist had conscious awareness of all relevant attendant
circumstances, including the substantial risks involved in making an appearance on _Nancy Grace_
while the trial of _State v. Nemetz_ was ongoing. Everyone else who knew of the proposed second
interview—<mark>DPA Greer, DPA Ausserer, and Ms. Songer—thought it was a bad idea and strongly
opposed it. Their concerns were conveyed to PA Lindquist, but he wanted to do the interview
anyway.</mark> Given the nature of PA Lindquist’s extrajudicial statements, the nature of the
proceeding, and the context and timing of the statements, as discussed above, it appears <mark>there
was a “substantial likelihood” that PA Lindquist’s statements would materially prejudice an
adjudicative proceeding</mark> or heighten public condemnation of the accused. In other words, it
appears <mark>there was “potential injury to a party or to the integrity of the legal process.”</mark>

<mark>Consequently, the presumptive sanction appears to be suspension under ABA Standards std. 5.22.</mark>

We believe the following <mark>aggravating factor</mark> identified in ABA Standards std. 9.22 may be
raised:

<ul>(i) substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1995).</ul>
We believe the following mitigating factor identified in ABA Standards std. 9.32 may be raised:
<ul>(a) absence of a prior disciplinary record.</ul>

Aggravating or mitigating factors may cause the sanction to vary from the presumptive sanction.

**CONCLUSION**

<mark>For the reasons set forth above, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel is recommending that the
Review Committee order this matter to hearing.</mark> The Review Committee will advise you of its
decision.

Sincerely,

Scott G. Busby  
Senior Disciplinary Counsel
