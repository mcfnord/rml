# Declaration of Bertha Fitzer

IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON 
IN AND FOR THE COUNTY OF PIERCE

In the Matter of: No. 15-2-10116-7

The Recall of Mark Lindquist, DECLARATION OF 
BERTHA F ITZE

Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney RE: RECALL OF 
MARK LINDQUIST


 

Bertha Fitzer declares as follows:

I am over the age of 18, am competent to testify, 
and have personal knowledge of the facts stated in 
this declaration.

I. INTRODUCTION

I am the managing partner of Fitzer, Leighton & 
Fitzer, PS. and have been in practice for 34 
years. Our firm is exclusively involved in civil 
practice. From January 29, 2001 to September 10, 
2010, I was employed as a Deputy Prosecuting 
Attorney (DPA) in the Pierce County Prosecutor’s 
Office, serving in the Civil. Felony and Juvenile 
Divisions.

I have attached as Exhibit 1 my complete C.V.. 
including professional activities and 
publications, to establish my credentials and 
competencies. Neither I, nor my firm, will benefit 
from Mr. Lindquist’s recall. My husband and. I are 
law partners and neither of us intend to seek any 
elected position.

11. MR. LINDS QUIST'S ACTIVITIES 2000 TO 2009

This section of the declaration relates to the 
charges in Charge D of the Statement of Charges, 
which allege that Mr. Lindquist has used his 
office to pursue his own personal interests. It 
also relates to Charge F involving mismanagement 
of the Office of Pierce

County Prosecuting Attorney.

A. Charge D: Use of Office to Promote Mark 
Lindquist’s Literary Career.

At the time 1 was hired by then Prosecutor John 
Ladenburg, Mark Lindquist was a trial attorney in 
the Sexual Assault Unit, or Team 4. He had 
recently published “Never Mind Nirvana,” a book 
based loosely on his experiences as a deputy 
prosecuting attorney in this

sexual assault unit. The following is a sample of 
his literary work during this period:

- Pete’s current favorite is a quote from a 
trailer park rapist who preferred underage girls, 
especially cousins:

<ul>I placed the defendant under arrest and read 
him his rights. When I asked him if he understood, 
he said, “What does a girl in Eatonviile say when 
she loses her Virginia»? ” I asked him again if he 
understood and he replied, “She says GET OFF ME, 
DAD, YOU’RE CR USHING MY SMOKES! ”</ul> - Mark 
Lindquist, Never Mind Nirvana, (V illard Books 
2000) p. 26. [italics in original copy.]

In 2007, Mr. Lindquist published “The King of 
Methlehem.”l The publication of this book came 
several years after Mr. Lindquist assumed the 
position of team leader in the drug un1t. The book 
contains a number of derogatory comments about 
past and current members of the judiciary, using 
their actual names. Just before he published this 
book, he convinced Prosecutor Gerald Home that Mr. 
Horne should sign a contract with “Piranha 
Entertainment.” The contract specified that a 
production team would follow Mr. Lindquist and 
film his activities as a DPA. Attached hereto as 
Exhibit 2 is a true and correct copy of the 
proposed contract with Piranha Entertainment. I, 
and others within the office, opposed the use of 
the Prosecutor’s Office for this purpose and the 
contract was never executed.

B. Uses of Public Resources for Political 
Discourse.

In November 2008, Mr. Lindquist appeared on local 
cable television as a commentator on the s1 
gnlficance of the election returns. The Pierce 
County Code proh1b1ts the use of County property 
and/or the use of County employee services during 
County time except in the conduct of official 
business. Pierce County Code §3.12.030 (1). 
Nonetheless, shortly after his appearance on 
television, Mr. Lindquist reprised the role of 
political pundit at the Law :3: Justice t'oimctl 
Meeting nt'Hoventher ltitJi-i. The l_av.' S; 
insttce «Council is a County agency, created by 
ordinance. Pierce County Code §2.98.040 describes 
the Council“s function and purpose: The Council 
may address any criminal justice issues including, 
but not limited to, the following: criminal 
justice resources, jail management, mechanisms for 
communication of information about offenders 
including the feasibility of shared database 
access between state and local government, 
transition of offenders into Pierce County, 
equitable offender program siting and maintenance, 
appropriateness of offender housing under zoning 
and other laws, assessment of reentry services, 
and state/local cooperation in supervising 
offenders.

The Council may also advise the County Council, 
County Executive, and other governmental entities 
and make such recommendations as it deems 
appropriate on matters relating to law and justice 
in Pierce County.

(0rd. 2007-69s § 1 (part), 2007; 0rd. 91-192 § 1 
(part), 1992)

The Law & Justice Council is a County funded 
agency that meets in the County/City Building. 
Staff from the Pierce County Prosecutor’s office 
set up the meeting, take minutes, and provide the 
refreshments, including lunches that are provided 
at taxpayer expense to the County officials who 
attend.

As author of the DOC Reportz, Gerald Home 
requested that I attend the Council’s monthly 
meetings to periodically update the Council with 
information pertaining to the Law & Justice 
Community Oversight Subcommittee. This standing 
subcommittee is the primary oversight mechanism to 
prevent the excessive “dumping” of released 
convicts in Pierce County. The Code outlines its 
duties:

1. The subcommittee shall have oversight of all 
issues involving transition of

offenders into the community, including review of 
county of origin and other

particulars of offenders released by the 
Department of Corrections, review of equitable 
offender program siting and maintenance, review of 
whether offender housing is appropriate under 
zoning and other laws, and contracting with the

Department of Corrections for community centre] of 
offender placement in work

release or residential reentry centers in Pierce 
County. Pierce County Code, §2.98.050(B)(l).

The day before the meeting, I received the agenda 
for the November 2008 meeting. The agenda listed 
the primary presentation as a political discussion 
of the election results by Mark Lindquist. I 
immediately emailed Mr. Home to inform him that 
this was an improper

use of County resources. Mr. Horne ignored my 
objections. He also obviously shared them

County’s High Crime Rate, Office of the Pierce 
County Prosecutor, 2007. This report was available 
to the public on the Pierce County Prosecutor’s 
website until Mr. Lindquist was appointed 
Prosecutor. I continued to work collecting the 
data regarding this issue, until Mr. Lindquist and 
Mr. Vanscoy removed me from the project after I 
announced my campaign.

I

This association provides valuable protections to employees, but also generates substantial

funds that are used for political purposes. For instance, the union transferred $34,645.59 to

Mr. Home’s 2001 campaign. At that time, the PCPAA did not have a separate political action I

committee (PAC). Instead, the union donated directly to political candidates. In 2007, I

served on the audit committee, which reviewed these transactions and delivered the report.

The audit report documented the amount of political donations the union had made. Upon

consultation with counsel, members of the union leadership closely associated with Mr.

Lindquist proposed that the union form a separate PAC. I spoke against the use of PCPAA

dues for political purposes. While unions generally have this right, prosecutors have special
obligations to the public and the justice system. At that time, Mr. Lindquist had already made

known his desire to replace Mr. Home. In a hotly contested vote, the membership decided to

form the PAC. Ms. Robnett was the President of the PCPAA at the time of that vote. After

his appointment in 2009, Mr. Lindquist promoted Ms. Robnett to the position of Chief

Criminal Deputy.

E. Charge D: Expenditures of Resources for Tacoma Pierce County Bar
Association and Impact on Judicial Qualifications Committee.

In about 2004, Mr. Lindquist and his supporters started to become very active in the

Tacoma Pierce County Bar Association (TPCBA). Membership in the local bar is neither a

prerequisite to practicing law nor a condition of employment with the County. DPA’s have

their own organization, the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys (WAPA),

which provides support and education tailored to public prosecutors.

During the time I was in the office, I observed a concerted effort to place members of

the office into leadership positions in the TPCBA. Select members of the office were

encouraged to apply for positions as trustees and officers within the TPCBA. Union officers
sent emails on County computers, listing the union’s candidates and reminding members to
vote. Union leaders offered to collect the ballots and deliver them to the Bar office.

One of the most important roles of the TPCBA involves vetting judicial candidates
through the Judicial Qualifications Committee or JQC. I chaired this committee from 2000-
20025, and was a member again in 2011. In 2011, I attended meetings for the evaluation of
judicial candidate, Sunni Ko. At least one member of the Prosecutoris Office was also on the
committee. In direct violation of the confidentiality rules of the committee, Ms. Ko learned
about discussions that took place the day before her interview.

[11. TIMING OF MY DECISION TO RUN FOR ELECTED PROSECUTOR

In September 2009, the Pierce County Council appointed Mr. Lindquist to replace the
retiring Gerald Horne. Because I believed Mr. Lindquist to be unfit for this important office, I
supported a different internal candidate who was passed over by Mr. Horne. That candidate
left the office in May 2010.

I first discussed a possible candidacy with trusted friends in September of 2009. Once
I learned that it was unlikely that anyone would challenge Mr. Lindquist in the 2010 election,
I discussed in length with my family and friends about what could be done. By early 2010, I
decided that I would run against him. I discussed my plans with several lawyers at the
TPCBA Lincoln Day Banquet in February 2010. Word began to spread. I was ready to

announce 1ny candidacy on March 26, 2010.

5 I have been active in the State and local bar throughout my career. This committee work pre-dated my
employment with the County. After I became a public employee, I took vacation time or worked after hours on
these activities.

On March 25, 2010, I bumped into a colleague after work at a local grocery story. I
told her that I had intended to announce that I was running for Prosecutor the next day, but
had decided to defer it to Monday out of respect for a colleague whose wifeis funeral was that
Saturday. On Friday, March 26, 2010, I took a vacation day to attend to volunteer activities at
Mary Bridge Children’s Hospital, where I served on the Board of Directors of The Mary
Bridge Children‘s Hospital Foundation. I attended the funeral on the 27th and learned then
that my colleague had shared my information with others associated with the office. Because
of the events described in detail below, I formally announced my candidacy on April 8, 2010.
IV. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS A DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY

Before addressing the need to delay my announcement and how that relates to Mr.
Lindquist’s abuse of office, some background regarding my experiences in the office is
necessary to provide context. I served in the Civil Division from January 29, 2001 to January
2006; in the Felony Division, Team 2, from January 2006 to January 2010; and in the Juvenile
Division from January 2010 to September 10, 2010. My results generated positive feedback
from County officials, the judiciary and peers. Attached hereto as Exhibit 3'5 is a true and
correct copy of some of the numerous comments praising my work and skills.

A. Positions Held as a DPA

In late 2000, John Landenberg hired me to defend the County in employment matters.
As I needed to wrap up my private practice, I actually began work on January 29, 2001. The
employment cases were insufficient in numbers and complexity to occupy my time fully. I

therefore sought out additional work. I successfully handled a number of major cases in land

use, torts and employment cases. During my first two years with in the Civil Division, Keith
Black, then Chief Civil Deputy, evaluated my performance three times. He rated me as
“outstanding” virtually across the board.

I started as a felony trial attorney in Team 2 in January, 2006. Under Gerald Horne,
Trial Team 2 was tasked with handling financial fraud, identity theft and arson. l was
assigned the arson caseload and a number of complicated fraud matters. The team leader,
working with Det. Glenda Nissen, representatives from local financial institutions and other
local and federal agencies, launched an initiative to prosecute organized fraud rings as
violations of Washington’s prohibitions on racketeering, aka “RICO” violations. These cases
were labor intensive and complex. I worked closely with Det. Nissen on my fraud cases
throughout my time in Team 2, just like I worked closely with the local fire investigators to
prepare my arson trials.

The 30 plus felony trials 1 litigated during this four-year period placed me towards the
top of the productivity rankings for deputy prosecuting attorneys in terms of both the number
of trials and the number of trial days. My evaluation, dated, February 27, 2009, rated me as
“outstanding” or “exceeding requirements” on 30 of the 32 categories. The remaining two
categories listed me as “meeting requirements.”

In late 2009, Mr. Lindquist informed Team 2 that he intended to reorganize our unit.
Our unit had achieved incredible results and high praise from victims and financial
institutions. To document that fact, I gathered data on the number of cases and charges our
unit was handling and the good things we were doing for the community. Attached hereto as

Exhibit 4 is a true and correct copy of this memorandum. Within hours of providing this

objective data of the unit’s productivity and success, Ms. Robnett came to my office to inform
2 me that Mr. Lindquist was transferring me to the Juvenile Division.
3 Mr. Lindquist made other changes in staff assignments at this time. He moved two
4 DPA’s who had little to no appellate experience to the Appellate Unit. Mr. Lindquist was
: well aware that I had clerked at the Washington Supreme Court, and had extensive experience
7 in appellate practice. Since 1990, I have been a member of the Ninth Circuit Court of
8 Appeals and US Supreme Court bars. I have done over one hundred appeals, including a
9 capital case, and six other aggravated murders. WAPA had assigned me the important task of
lo authoring several amicus briefs, and assigned me to be a WAPA representative on the
11 Washington State Pattern Jury Instruction Committee.
12 The decision to send me to the Juvenile Division was retaliation for my opposition to
13 Mr. Lindquist’s use of the office to enhance his media presence, his use of union funds to
14 finance political activities, his misuse of public resources, and his gutting of a highly
15 functioning trial unit. The assignment to Roman Hall physically isolated me from the main

there were no documents that suggested that any DPAT had complained about the way I

handled my arson or fraud cases.

C. January 2010 to September 10, 2010: Juvenile Division

I served as the “barrel deputy” at Reman Hall from January 2010 until I resigned my

position effective September 10, 2010. The work consisted primarily of sitting at a desk in

the courtroom and processing paperwork. This is work that could have easily been done by a

first-year DPA. While I faithfully performed my professional tasks at Reman Hall, it was

made clear there was never going to be an opportunity to return to felony prosecutions or

effectively use my trial and appellate skills to benefit the public.

D. Handling of Remaining Felony Cases

Just prior to my transfer to the Juvenile Division, I went through all of my arson cases

to prepare them for transfer to Trial Unit I. I wrote transfer memos on every significant case,

outlining the facts, the critical issues, and my recommendations. At the time, my caseload

included a number of significant cases involving defendants who had exhibited very

dangerous conduct. Arsonists tend to be repeat offenders and their conduct often escalates.

Consistent with my obligation to put public protection at the forefront, I had maintained a

hardline on these cases. After my transfer, I was allowed to keep three, low profile cases.

I settled two of the three cases with felony charges. The third case, State v. Douglas,

Pierce County No. 04-1-05086-5, was originally tried by my predecessor. After this first

conviction was reversed, I assumed responsibility for the retrial. The defense lawyer

repeatedly offered to have his client plead guilty as charged, because the standard range

responsibility.

the custody exchange of his infant daughter. He then knocked him down while the victim was
holding the infant. He continued to kick and punch the man until help arrived.

Mr. Douglas was charged with Assault in the Second Degree. Before he could be tried
on the assault charges, the defendant snuck into the home of his wife, child, and in—laws while
they were at church. He spread gasoline throughout the house, including on his child’s crib.
He then ignited the house, setting off an explosion that endangered firefighters and
neighboring property.

My concern for the safety of the community and Mr. Douglas’s victims caused me to
delay my departure from the office until I had fulfilled my commitment to ensure justice was
done. I successfully tried this case the summer of 2010. On August 27, 2010, I obtained an
exceptional sentence of 480 months (40 years). The Court of Appeals has affirmed both the

conviction and the exceptional sentence. See State 12. Douglas, 173 Wn. App. 849 (2013)

allegations contained in Charge D involving intimidation of, and retaliation against, deputy

A. Mr. Lindquist’s First Attempt to Intimidate Me

As noted above, I had intended to announce my campaign on Friday March 26, 2010
but chose to delay it to Monday March 29, 2010. Returning to the office Monday morning, I
found an email hom the human resource officer, Becky Stover, and an envelope on official
stationery on my desk. The envelope contained a “Written Warning” signed by Mr.
Lindquist’s Chief Criminal Deputy, Mary Robnett. Ms. Stover’s email stated that she had left
this letter for me “late” on the 26th. The “warning” which was subsequently renamed
“reprimand“ accused me of failing to meet performance expectations regarding the
preparation of my arson cases. Attached hereto as Exhibit 5 is a true and correct copy of the
letter of reprimand. This letter came 77 days (mar I had transferred these cases.

Under County policy, only the appointing authority, Mr. Lindquist, had the authority
to discipline me. Mr. Lindquist caused this disciplinary letter to be placed in my personnel
file. Neither he nor anyone on his staff had contacted me to discuss the alleged
“performance“ issues described in the letter. As the County”s former employment litigator, I
knew that this was contrary to the County’s procedures governing employee discipline.
County procedures contemplate a discipline process that is interactive with the employee.
The employer first alerts the employee of the specific performance deficiencies. The
employer then must allow the employee an opportunity to respond and/or explain why the
charges do not have merit. The final step, after this discussion, is to draft a formal letter of
reprimand, if the employee’s explanations are inadequate. Mr. Lindqui st followed none of

these steps. Instead the letter was delivered to my personnel file on the day it was written.

I immediately requested an opportunity to review the “investigation file” that allegedly
supported the discipline. I discovered that the “referral” for the disciplinary action against me
was made at 1:18 pm on March 26, 2010. Attached hereto as Exhibit 6 is a true and correct
copy of the “referral” email that documents this time. In the space of three hours, the
“investigation” was completed, a letter of reprimand drafted, placed in my personnel file and
delivered to my desk at the Juvenile Division at Reman Hall. The person making the referral
never contacted me to ask about my preparation of the cases. This person later was appointed
to the position of Superior Court Judge.

B. Mr. Lindquist’s Knowledge of My Intent to File

1 had no knowledge of the letter of reprimand until the morning of March 29, 2010.

On March 28 or 29, 2010, someone anonymously purchased, through Domains by Proxy, the
domain names of “BerthaFitzercom,” “BerthaFitzerorg,” and “BerthaFitzernet.” Attached
hereto as Exhibit 7 is a true and correct copy of the documentation of that purchase.

Dealing with the letter of reprimand delayed my formal campaign announcement to
April 8, 2010. After I made that announcement and informed Mr. Lindquist that my
campaign website would be FitzertorUscom, a second anonymous purchase of domain names
with variations of the “FitzerforUs” was made. Attached hereto as Exhibit 8 is a true and
correct copy of the records that document that purchase. Mr. Lindquist was one of a very few
people who had information regarding the name of my website because I had provided it to
him in my announcement.

My husband represented my interests during the disputes with Mr. Lindquist over the
domain names and their use. Attached hereto as Exhibit 9 is a true and correct copy of a letter

dated May 4, 2010 addressed to Mr. Lindquist requesting corrective action regarding the

cybersquatting. By this date. Mr. Lindquist’s campaign had used the domain names to
construct a phony website that diverted traffic from my website to that of Mr. Lindquisti's
campaign. the official County Prosecutor’s website and the website of the Pierce County
Sheriff. Attached hereto as Exhibit 10 is a true and correct copy of the documentation
showing search results for Bertha Fitzer and the phony websites created in May of 2010 to
interfere with my campaign.

Just before the November election, I requested access to the receipts of the Lindquist
campaign so that I could determine whether expenditures Mr. Lindquist’s campaign identified
on public disclosure documents were associated with this cybersquatting incident. Chief
Criminal Deputy Mary Robnett and DPA Grant Blinn, represented the Lindquist campaign at
that meeting. Neither Ms. Robnett nor Mr. Blinn had the requested receipts. When I insisted
that I wanted to inspect the actual receipts for March and April 2010, I was told that I would
get them the next day. The following day, Mr. Lindquist’s representative called me and
admitted that Mr. Lindquistis campaign had in fact purchased the following domain names:
1) BerthaFitzer.com; 2) BerthaFitzer.net; 3) BerthaFitzer.org; 4) FitzerforUs.net; and 5:
Fitzerfor'USorg in March and April of2010. In statements to' The News Tribune, the
representative stated that the campaign intended to use them more extensively had I run a
more “effective” campaign.8

The timing of these purchases demonstrates that the rushed and phony “reprimand”
was a response to knowledge that I was about to announce my candidacy. There was

absolutely no reason for Mr. Lindquist’s campaign to purchase these names unless, or the time

.Mr. Lindquisr authorized the letter ofreprimand, he knew that I planned to run against him

and was about to kick off my campaign. Mr. Lindquist used the phony reprimand and the

dirty tricks to try to derail any opposition to him.

i F. Mr. Lindquist’s Use of the Union for His Own Political Purpose

Without my knowledge or consent. Mr. Lindquist 
provided a copy of the March 26,

2010 letter to the president of the Pierce County 
Prosecutors Attorney Association (PCPAA),

John Sheeran. Ms. Robnett called her letter a 
“warning,” not a reprimand. A warning letter is

not a disciplinary action and cannot be grieved, 
but a reprimand is. Because I could not

grieve a letter of warning, there was no justification for breaching my confidentiality by

sharing this document with the union president. Had I desired union assistance, it should have

been my option to seek it. Nonetheless. Mr. Sheeran, a long-time supporter of Mr. Lindquist,

knew of this warning letter before I did. Attached hereto as Exhibit 11 is a true and correct

copy of the letter I received from Mr. Sheeran the morning of March 29, 2010 documenting

that Mr. Sheeran received it on March 26, 2010.

The grievance process. supposedly designed for fairness and to insulate employees

fiom hostile supervisors, was controlled by Mr. Lindquist. I initially asked for an extension
of time to prepare a response. This request was denied. Given that fact, and the fact that Mr.

Lindquist would personally decide the merits of my grievance, I elected to forgo the grievance

process and simply reSpond in writing to the charges contained in the letter of reprimand.

Throughout the campaign, Mr. Lindquist falsely maintained that my decision to run

I for Pierce County Prosecutor was the result of the letter of reprimand. My campaign was not

the result of Mr. Lindquist’s reprimand. The timing of Mr. Lindquist’s opportunistic purchase

of my name for use in his campaign establishes the reprimand was the result of his knowledge
of my decision to challenge him, not the other way around.

G. Merits of Reprimand

The reprimand charged me with failing to interview witnesses for upcoming trials,
failing to prepare witness lists, and failure to send out trial subpoenas in a timely fashion.
After obtaining the “investigative file,” I reviewed all of the documents relating to the cases
listed in the charges. That exercise revealed that Trial Unit 1 had pled all but one of my
former cases to substantially reduced charges. The bulk of these pleas took place in January
2010, immediately after I transferred the cases to Team 1.

One case was tried. Trial attorney, Ms. Sunni Ko, handled this case in a way that
demonstrates that the grounds for the reprimand were pre-textual. The letter of reprimand
faulted me for failing to file a witness list9 and issue subpoenas sufficiently in advance of trial.
There was no office policy on these topics. My practice was to only do the witness list and
subpoenas when the defense lawyer and I agreed the case was ready for trial. This practice
had never been an issue and saved the County money associated with the repeat issuance of
trial subpoenas.

The way Ms. Ko prepared for trial illustrates that my practice was followed by others
in the office. Ms. Ko received the file in January 2010, but did not file a witness list and send
subpoenas until just immediately before the trial. Attached hereto as Exhibit 12 is a true and

correct copy of Ms. Ko’s witness list, filed just one week before the trial. Ms. K0 was not

disciplined even though the timing of her pre-trial preparation was consistent with what was
identified as a performance deficiency for me in the letter of reprimand.

I prepared a rebuttal to the charges and requested that Mr. Lindquist place my rebuttal
in my file. Attached hereto as Exhibit 13 is a true and correct copy of my response rebutting
the specifics of the letter of reprimand. Mr. Lindquist and Ms. Robnett both responded to my
rebuttal with vicious personal attacks, suggesting that it was improper for me to raise claims
of disparate discipline.

In one response, Mr. Lindquist brought up my opposition to the union‘s formation of
the PAC, citing it as a “petty complaint” against the Pierce County Prosecutor’s Association.
He also invited me to “move on.” Attached hereto as Exhibit 14 is a true and correct copy of
Mr. Lindquist’s letter of April 14, 2010 referring to the dispute with the union. Mr. Lindquist
placed these letters in my personnel file.

I found additional support for the claim that I was being treated differently when, two
weeks after my reprimand, Division Two of the Court of Appeals severely chastised Ms. Ko
and another team leader in State v. Venegas, 155 Wn. App.507, 228 P. 3d 813 (April 2010).
This case involved charges of First and Second Degree Child Assault arising from the brutal,
repeated, beating of a young boy. It was tried by Ms. Ko10 and Mr. Kevin McCann“. The
Court of Appeals remanded the case for a new trial for two reasons. First, the court found
these prosecutors had “committed fiagraat prosecutorial misconduct by repeatedly attacking

Venegas's presumption of innocence with improper arguments that had no basis in law.” Veaegas,

4 witness was going to say. There are only two explanations for the claim of surprise: either the

5

7 questions. The improper argument and their failure to prepare the case led the Court of

8 Appeals to reverse both the conviction and the original sentence of 171 months.

9 In dealing with the letter of reprimand, I cited 
this case as an example of evidence that 10 I was 
being singled out for adverse treatment. On May 6, 
2010, the Chief Civil Deputy, Mr. 11 Vanscoy, 
wrote to state that Mr. Lindquist would not 
discuss the case of State v. Venegas. l2 Attached 
hereto as Exhibit 15 is a true and correct copy of 
this letter. l3 Nine months after the case was 
reversed, Mr. McCann allowed the defendant to plea 
to a 14 single count of second-degree child 
assault. He recommended that the defendant receive 
the low
:: end of the standard range, or 31 months.

1 7 In 2010, I filed a public disclosure request for any disciplinary actions against these two
18 indixdduals. There was none. Mr. Lindquist subsequently supported the judicial aspirations of
19 both Mr. McCann and Ms. Ko.

2 o H. Continued Harassment

21 After March 26, 2010, Mr. Lindquist, Ms. Robnett, Ms. Farina and Mr. Vanscoy

22 papered my file with various derogatory missives, all of which were false and designed to

2 3 I either force me to resign or scuttle my campaign. They printed every letter on Pierce County

exposition on all the derogatory letters is beyond the scope of this declaration, one additional

letter lilrther supports charges that Mr. Lindquist abuses the power of his office.

As noted above, Charge F involves Mr. Lindquist’s 
mismanagement of the office, which results in 
numerous reversals for prosecutorial misconduct. 
Mr. Lindquist”s mismanagement stems from his 
complete inability to recognize prosecutorial 
misconduct. (See discussion in Part II, C above). 
His personal record in this area establishes this 
fact. I

raised this issue throughout the 2010 election. My 
first speech on this topic drew another official 
“warning.” In this letter, Chief of Staff Dawn 
Farina took me to task for a campaign speech I 
gave on Saturday, June 19, 2010. The theme of this 
speech was that Mr. Lindquist, as a trial 
attorney, had repeatedly been reversed for 
prosecutorial misconduct and other trial 
irregularities. I focused on the cost of second 
trials and his decision to avoid second trials by 
letting the defendants plea to lesser charges. I 
obtained the data for this speech from a public 
records request answered by his office. Attached 
hereto as Exhibit 16 is a true and correct copy of 
that portion of Mr. Lindquist’s public disclosure 
response, which showed there were nine reversals 
of felony cases handled primarily or jointly by 
Mr. Lindquist.

Neither Mr. Lindquist, Ms. Robnett nor Ms. Farina, 
were present at this event. Mr. McCann appeared as 
a candidate for district court judge. As I was 
speaking, I noticed that he

was frantically texting someone.

Three days later, Ms. Farina delivered another 
letter of warning. She accused me of “dishonesty” 
for the statements I made on June 19, 2010 about 
Mr. Lindquist’s record. Attached hereto as Exhibit 
17 is a true and correct copy of this letter. I 
objected to this letter and pointed out that I had 
relied on the data provided by the prosecutor’s 
public records

officer. After the speech, the office “amended” 
this public disclosure response to show that

Mr. Lindquist had only five reversals”. Attached hereto as Exhibit 18 is a true and correct
copy of the amended disclosure.

It is ironic that Ms. Farina was the one to reprimand me for exercising my First
Amendment right to speak about Mr. Lindquist’s inability to try cases without legal errors or

misconduct. Ms Farina has brought national ridicule to the office of the Pierce County

Prosecutor for the recent reversal in State 12. Walker, 182 Wn. 2d 463 (2015). Attached hereto
as Exhibit 19 is a true and correct copy of the April 27, 2015 article in the American Bar
Association Litigation News discussing the decision and the clearly improper conduct of Ms.

Farina.

I. Intimidation of Other Members of the Public.

In addition to misusing the disciplinary process, 
Mr. Lindquist used the power of his office to 
intimidate members of the community. Prior to the 
letter of reprimand, l was the Chair-Elect of the 
Mary Bridge Children’s Hospital Foundation.13 I 
had served as a Director on that board since 2003. 
My husband and I had personally raised close to 
$200,000 for the Child Abuse Intervention 
Department (CAID). CAlD works closely with the 
schools, law enforcement and the Prosecutor’s 
Office to investigate and treat child abuse.

Periodically, Mary Bridge, and the other participants, renew their commitment to
cooperation by signing “protocols.” During the summer of 201 0, a protocol signing was
scheduled. Because of the work my family and I had done to support this cause, and because
I served on the Board, Mary Bridge officials asked me to speak at the protocol signing on

behalf of Mary Bridge. Mr. Lindquist and Ms. Robnett learned of this, called officials at

12 The sixth reversal referred to above was tried in 2009 and reversed on appeal after Mr. Lindquist’s election.
13 After the letter of reprimand, I declined the position rather than risk bad publicity for the Hospital.

1 Mary Bridge and threatened to withdraw their support of the event ifI appeared on the

2 podium. The importance of the support of the Prosecutor’s Office to the CAID programs

3 caused Mary Bridge officials to bow to Mr. Lindquisti’s inappropriate pressure. The Vice

4 President of Philanthropy called me and informed me of their decision to withdraw the

: invitation and that the reason for that withdrawal was the threat from the Prosecutor’s office.
7 A second incident occurred when one of the individuals I had worked with to raise

a funds for CAID did a campaign video about Mr. Lindquist’s abysmal record on prosecuting

9 sex abuse cases. We filmed this video in front of the sign for the Safe & Sound Building.
10 Pierce County investigators interview abused children at this facility, forensic examinations

11 are done here and children receive counseling at this location. We filmed the video on the

12 sidewalk, not on Mary Bridge property and this fact was clearly visible in the video.

13 Nonetheless, within 24 hours of the time we posted this video on the internet, Mr. Lindquist’s
l4 campaign called another member of the Office of Philanthropy at Mary Bridge to insist that
:: Mary Bridge object to the appearance of the sign in the video. That individual called me and
17 passed along the message. My campaign ultimately redid the video at a different location.

18 J. Use of Staff'in Political Activities

19 Mr. Lindquist typically would not appear to debate the issues I raised during the

2 0 campaign. Instead, he sent his Chief Criminal Deputy, Mary Robnett, as his “representative.”

2 1 DPA Grant Blinn served as his campaign manager. Mr. Blinn has now obtained a position as

22 a municipal court judge. Younger, attractive members of the office appeared at his campaign

this ceiling from spouses of the office’s employees. For instance, Ms. Robnett revealed during
a campaign event that her husband had made the maximum contribution to Mr. Lindquist’s
campaign.

I understand that Ms. Robnett subsequently left her position as Chief Criminal Deputy.

I do not know the reason for this change. In January 2015, however. Ms. Robnett approached

me at a professional meeting and graciously offered me an unsolicited apology.

VI. INTERFERENCE WITH RIGHTS OF OTHER COUNTY EMPLOYEES

This section further discusses Charge L involving interference with other County
employees. Det. Nissen and I worked together on a number of complex cases. My work on
those cases led to her public support of my 2010 campaign. In May 2010, Det. Nissen
assisted me in getting the endorsement of the Pierce County Sheriff’ 3 Deputy Association.
She and my son erected campaign signs when she was not on duty. On June 5, 2010, she
drove her car, with me and my campaign signs, in a local parade. Mr. Lindquist’s repeated
attempts to tie Det. Nissen to an allegedly threatening letter sent on June 7, 2010 to Mary
Robnett, coincides with his knowledge of her role in my campaign and his anger at not
initially being endorsed by the Deputy‘s Association.

I learned in December 2010 that Det. Nissen had misused public property by sending
an email denouncing Mr. Lindquist back in June of 2010. I first learned of this incident when
a detective called me into the Sheriff 3 office to question me about the Robnett letter. The
interview was the first and only time I saw this letter. Neither I nor my son had any
knowledge of it or Det. Nissen’s email. I reported to the investigator that it was extremely
unlikely that Det. Nissen was the source of the letter. I provided my songs telephone number

and I understand he too was called. He confirmed that there was little likelihood that she was

1 involved. I believe Mr. Lindquist’s attempts to tie Det. Nissen to this letter simply reflect his

anger at the role she played in supporting my campaign.

3 CONCLUSION

4 Mr. Lindquist has responded to claims made by members of his staff in

: whistleblowers by asserting that the people making the complaints are simply disgruntled

7 employees. His approach now is virtually identical to his fabricated political rhetoric that my
a E campaign was about a bad employee who wanted revenge. To silence me, and win his

9 election, Mr. Lindquist intentionally violated my First Amendment right to speak on matters
10 of public concern, abused his position of power and attempted to intimidate me, those

11 associated with my campaign and other members of the community. The statute of

12 limitations for conduct concerning me has long passed. There is no financial benefit to me in

13 . . . . . . .
coming forward with the facts contalned 1n this declaration. Although I am now unmvolved

14
with the criminal justice system, I remain deeply concerned about the professional health of

15
the Pierce County Prosecutor’s office, the well—being of the true public servants that I was
16

17 privileged to work alongside, and most importantly, the people of Pierce County.

19 foregoing is true and correct.

ENTERTAENMENT

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING

This letter of understanding is intended to clarify the planned production
needs/requirements of Piranha Entertainment (a Seattle based TV production
company) for a documentary series currently called The Prosecutor(Working
Title) Piranha Entertainment will work in concert with the Pierce County Sheriffs’
and Prosecuting Attorneys’ offices during the course of the production.

The series will follow the activities of prosecuting attorney, Mark Lindquist, and
members of the Pierce County prosecutor’s office in their efforts to dispense
justice. Piranha will work with the prosecutor’s office to plan production shoots in
advance so as to have the least impact on staff. It is anticipated that a crew
(videographer, sound person, and producer) will spend one or two days a week
over the course of a 10—12 week production period, following key cases that go
through the prosecutors’ office, and specifically those cases handled by Mark
Lindquist. Any courtroom photography will be cleared in advance of production.
Occasionally, a second crew may be needed to obtain adequate coverage.

Piranha Entertainment is responsible for obtaining all personal and location
releases during the course of filming.

The series will also involve documenting a special unit of the Pierce County
sheriff’s department and their efforts to combat criminal activity in the Tacoma
area. it is anticipated that a crew (a photographer, sound person, and producer),
coordinated through a member of the sheriff’s department will spend 2 to 4 days
a week documenting enforcement activities of the department over the course of
an estimated 10-12 week period. Again, pre-production planning with the
Sheriffs’ office will insure the least amount of impact on the staff. Piranha is
responsible for obtaining all personal and location releases.

Piranha Entertainment will make best efforts to schedule and execute production
so as to minimize the impact of the production on Pierce County or its taxpayers.

The Pierce County sheriff’s and prosecutor’s offices acknowledge that Piranha
Entertainment is investing substantial time and money in this project, and will
make best efforts to accommodate the production timelines and requirements.

Prior to production, Piranha Entertainment will present Pierce County a copy of
the company’s liability insurance policy. In addition, as part of their agreement,

Piranha and Pierce County will agree to mutually indemnify and held each other
harmless from all claims arising out of breach of their agreement.

ACCEPTED AND AGREED:

MARK LINDQUIST

Me m 0 Prosecuting Attorney

To: Mark Lindquist; Dam Farina; Mary Robnett
From: Bertha B. F itzer
Date: 12/15/2009

Re: Reallocation of Resources/Attorney moves

This memorandum addresses the impact of the mandated restructuring of Team 2. I have
gathered data regarding the actual current cases loads of Team 3 and Team 2 and the actual
number of felony counts being handled by each team currently. I offer this information to
management in the hopes that a clearer understanding of the available data will foster a discussion

of how best to serve the public’s interests in the most efficient manner possible. I fear that the data
suggests the current plan would be highly detrimental to those goals.

 

 

Let me explain first what information I examined. I spent Friday and Saturday of Thanksgiving
weekend pulling data regarding the actual cases being handled by both teams. To do this, Iran
each attorney’s current trial calendar through November 2010 and entered all the data into
spreadsheets. Because I was also curious regarding the interrelationship of the identity theft cases
to other charges, for Team 2 only, I broke each case down into its component charges. For Team
3, I simply entered the case name and the total number of charges. I did not attempt to distinguish
between felony and misdemeanor charges. I know Team 2 has a few cases that have misdemeanor
charges attached to the felony charges, however, that number is fairly small.

As of November 27? 2009, the six attorneys in Team 2 had a total of 208 cases set for trial or

34.66 cases per attorney. Team 3 had slightly fewer cases but an overall average. That team had
193 cases set for trial or an average of 38.6 cases per attorney.

This superficial analysis would suggest that Team 3 attorneys actually had a higher work load
than did Team 2 attorneys.

The total number of cases tells only a small part of the story. however. The attorneys in Team 2
handle a total of 1260 counts or an average of 210 counts per attorney. This comes out to an
average of 6.05 counts per case. In contrast. Team 3 attorneys handle 89 counts per

attorney. A team 3 case typically has an average of 2.3 counts. The following table reveals the
disparity of the actual case load of attorneys in the 2 teams:

 

Team 2/ Team 3: Average COUnts per Attorney

Team 3 33
Team 2 2'“)

 

It is important to understand the full magnitude of the differences established by this data.
Fraud cases with multiple counts. unlike other types of crimes. typically involve multiple events

and multiple victims. This fact means that the attorney handling the case typically prepares the
case as a series of smaller cases within the larger whole.

These numbers also mean that the cases handled by 
this team impact a greater number of the members 
of the public. For example, in the RICO case I 
tried this summer. State v. Larry Hayes, the 
defendant had the credit card number of over 800 
members of the public. The RICO case that Lisa and 
I settled in 2008, likewise had many victims and 
hundreds of thousands of dollars of losses to 
banks and individuals. The individuals who commit 
these crimes wreck havoc on the credit and lives 
of thousands of people. Moreover. these 
individuals are frequently extremely dangerous. 
The RICO charges that this office has brought 
frequently involve issues of witness

intimidation, threats and a subculture of violence. It is for this reason that RICO is a level IX
charge and a strike offense.

The financial crimes are frequently also the best mechanism for putting dangerous offenders away
or enhancing the offender scores. Rosie got a murder second conviction on an individual whose
priors included a number of financial crimes. Referrals to this office also suggested that he was a
sex offender who abused children. The child sex cases couldn’t be proved. The financial crimes
could. As a result, when he was sentenced his offender score was significantly greater and this

dangerous murderer is behind bars essentially for the rest of his life.

I tried eases this spring against a sex offender who preyed on young girls. I got convictions for
identity theft, forgeries and unlawful issuance of bank checks. His time will run consecutive to

[that obtained in the sex cases.

I also want to address the impact of the proposed reduction in attorneys, which are significant. If
the team is left with just three attorneys, one of whom has no experience in these crimes, the end
result will be an even greater increase in the felony load of the remaining attorneys. The following
chart documents that result.

Counts Per Attorney

Team 3 89
Team 2 230

 

Finally, I also wanted to address the issue of how the proposal would impact my ability to
assist in the important project of identifying imports into Pierce County. My work in this team has
been assisted by use of Adobe, Excel and other programs that allow me to track and analyze data

concerning the import of offenders into Pierce County. These are the very same programs that I
use in the complex cases. I am one of the few attorneys who have these programs and use them on

a regular basis. To do the large RICO cases and Identity Theft cases, these resources are very
important. Yet if I move, I either have to surrender these programs so that others in the unit will

have them, or the County will have to buy additional licenses.

Even more importantly, for the first time, I have direct access to an important resource on
a daily basis. With Bill Garrison now in the same suite, we have been able to touch base more
frequently and discuss issues pertaining to this project which I believe the current Administration
views as a high priority. Lisa has been invaluable also in assisting me in this endeavor. She was
responsible for helping Complete the first DOC report. We are now discussing the need for follow-
up. Without her assistance, and that of Bill Garrison, that task will be even more difficult. Moving
me physically from the unit will thus be highly detrimental to my ability to push forward on this

project.

Thank you for the opportunity of letting me document my concerns. I know consistent with the
core values of this office, you will give them full and fair consideration. I have attached copies of
the spreadsheets, some samples of how I use these programs in other cases and other pertinent

materials.

Bertha Fitzer

Juvenile Division

SUBJECT: WRITTEN WARNING

Dear Bertha:

The specific charge leading to this written warning are stated in the office Administrative
Guidelines, Chapter 3.40.020 Outline of Grounds for Discipline, and include the following:

1. Failure to meet reasonable work performance standards and requirements.

The specific events leading to this written warning are outlined below.

In November of 2009, you were informed you would be transferring nom Trial Team II to
the Juvenile Division. At that time you were asked to prepare your case load for
redistribution to other deputy prosecutors for a transfer date of January 11, 2010. Most of
your Team II case load was redistributed to Trial Teams I, II and III when you transferred

divisions.

After your transfer, it came to my attention that numerous colleagues complained about the
poor and incomplete case preparation on several of your files that were redistributed.
Some of the problematic cases are listed below.

Trial Team I received the case of State v. Collins, 09-1-00218-9, on January 10, 2010. The
trial was set for rebruary 1, 2010. The case was arraigned on January 28, 2009 and was
nearly one year old. The defendant remained in custody. The file had no witness list. No
subpoenas had been issued. The witnesses had never been interviewed. Certified
Judgments and Sentence had never been ordered, but were required to resolve the case.

There was no offer in the file.

Trial Team I received the file of State v. Costales 09-1-03402-0, on January 4, 2010 and
the case had a trial date of January 27, 2010. The file contained a witness list but no
subpoenas had been issued. The defense had not agreed to a continuance. No witness
interviews had been conducted. Attempts to contact witnesses revealed that two necessary
witnesses were on military deployment in Iraq. The only offer in the file was plead as

charged.

Printed on recycled paper

Trial Team I received the case of State v. Ter_ry, 09-1-02262-5, on January 4, 2010 and the
case was set for trial on February 23, 2010. The case was arraigned on May 1, 2009. The

file contained no witness list and no witnesses had been subpoenaed. No witness
interviews had been conducted. The allegations involved having to prove the defendant
possessed an explosive device with the intent to use it for “an unlawful purpose.” The
defendant told police he kept the material when he was discharged from the military. The
material was found in a closet while police were looking for a gun. There appears to be a

significant issue regarding the State’s ability to prove the defendant’s intent. The case was
over eight months old and there had been no offer made on the case.

Trial Team I received the case of State v. Ripoli, 09-1-00044—3, on January 10, 2010 and
the trial was set for March 25, 2010. The State had filed a persistent offender notice,
alleging this was the defendant’s third strike. The file contained no witness list. No
subpoenas had been issued. Certified copies of prior Judgment and Sentence documents
were never requested. No witnesses had been interviewed, including police officers. The
case involved a significant search issue. There had been no research documented
regarding the search issue. The case was over a year old and no offer had ever been made.

Your recommendation on the transfer memo was that the case proceed to trial on a third
strike.

Trial team I received the case of State v. Verhul, 09-1-03296-5, on January 4, 2010. The
case was set for trial on February 4, 2010 and Omnibus Hearing was set for January 12,
2010. There was a witness list, but it had not been filed. There was no 911 tape ordered.
The newly assigned DPA ordered a 911 tape of several frantic, relevant phone calls. The
911 tape was obtained just prior to the 180 day mark when such recordings are deleted.
Discovery was not complete. The file was missing the reports and photographs of the
Tacoma Fire Department investigators. Neither Computer Aided Dispatch reports nor the

property reports were in the file. Without these reports, fire personnel, who were
necessary witnesses, could not be identified.

In October of 2009, The News Tribune inquired about a. significant delay in charging the
case of State v. LeGassey, 09-1-04261-8. The case was referred to our office on January 9,
2008 and you did not charge it until almost 11 months later on September 22, 2009. At the
time you took-full responsibility for the delay explaining that the case got misplaced within
your office and did not surface again until September 2009.

As a County Attorney 3 in the Criminal Division, you are expected to manage a high
volume of cases in an efficient, organized, effective and thorough manner. It is standard
practice for Felony attorneys to timely prepare and file a witness list, issue subpoenas and
conduct interviews on cases set for trial. It is also expected that cases will be reviewed for
charges in a timely manner. Based on the cases noted above, it appears you failed to meet
these expectations on a number of occasions. While you worked in the Civil Division, you
were counseled by your supervisors regarding your need to better prepare for your cases
after two department directors complained about your lack of preparation in handling
county cases for their departments. Your failure to meet these expectations has resulted in

more work for your colleagues and delay in justice for offenders, for victims and for the
community.

I have been made aware that other cases previously assigned to you are now resolving and
likely were not handled appropriately by you. This investigation continues and you are

advised that any future behavior by you of the type described above will not be tolerated
and is subject to further discipline, up to and including discharge.

Sincerely,

 

Chic Criminal Deputy

Gentlemen:

As Mr. Lindquist knows, I represent candidate Bertha Fitzer. I write to bring your
attention to the fact that someone associated with the Mark Lindquist Campaign is engaging in
inappropriate and ethically dubious behavior regarding internet domain names. Mr. Lindquist,
this is your opportunity to step up and set the tone for this election by informing all those
associated with your bid to cease and desist interference with Ms. F itzer’s campaign. Sheriff
Pastor is also receiving this letter because one of the offending items has been linked to the
Pierce County Sheriff Department’s official website. I’m confident the behavior set forth below

is being done without Sheriff Pastor’s knowledge because he has a strong sense of ethics and
propriety.

The facts are as follows: Ms Fitzer discussed her intent to challenge Mr. Lindquist with
members of the public on personal time in the months leading up to March 26, 2010. The initial
timing options were either March 26 or March 29, 2010, and arose in discussions with one or
more of her colleagues in the context of whether, out of respect for the death of a colleague’s
wife, she should delay the announcement. Bertha decided that a later date was more appropriate.
Late on the afternoon of March 26, 2010, a Letter of Relprimand was delivered to her desk in her
absence. Ms. F itzer had taken a vacation day on the 261t to attend to important meetings at Mary

Bridge Children’s Hospital. The false accusations set forth in the Letter of Reprimand have
already been addressed fully in prior correspondence.

On March 28, or 29, 2010, before Bertha had even seen the alleged disciplinary letter, the
domain names of “berthafitzer.con'1, berthaiitzerlnet and bertlfaiitiemrg” were purchased over
the intemet using a private service, Domains by Proxy, Inc. As a result, people searching for
“berthaiitzer.com., .org, or .net” on a search engine such as Google, find themselves actually
directed to a website supporting Mr. Lindquist. (Attachment 1). While the ethical implications

of one attorney co-opting the name of another for political gain have not yet been hilly litigated,
I can assure you that each and every lawyer, judge and member of the public who have heard the

recitation of these facts has expressed outrage.

Shortly after the name grab, a “Site under construction“ notice was put up on the
“berth'afitzaicom” site referring to forthcoming “true facts” of “Bertha Fitzer’s politics”, and
directing the reader to Mr. Lindquist’s campaign site. (Attachment 2) Since that date, the site
has been modified several times. It now contains only the reference “Site under construction.”
However, if you print the pertinent page, (Attachment 3) clearly visible is the direction to
viewers to go to three websites: Mr. Lindquist’s campaign site, the official Pierce County
Prosecutor’s site and the official Pierce County Sheriff’s website (misspelled). The latter two are
owned and Operated by the County, and clearly are not supposed to be used for political or

campaign activity.

The story does not end here. On April 9, 2010, Bertha announced that she would seek the

office of Prosecuting Attorney. Mr. Lindquist, you were the only one provided with a courtesy
copy of the press release which included the notation that additional information would be
available on her website “fitz'E'ffo'fu'sTo'i'g.” Bertha’s letter to her colleagues purposefully did n_ot
refer to her website because she did not want to involve them in her campaign. (Attachment 4)
The announcement appeared in the News Tribune on April 10, 2010. That article did n_ot refer to
her website. None the less, on nit-i11- l7lf'?20'-110, the domain names “fitzEforuscom and
fitz'erfrir'tiEiEt” were also purchased by anonymous sources unconnected with her campaign.
Again, the identical “under construction” notice appears. People trying to reach her campaign,
but entering “.com” instead of “.org“ are automatically redirected to “b‘érth'5fit2€f53$n”.
(Attachment 3) Thus the person or persons responsible for these activities are one in the same,
and directly linked to your campaign. It is no accident that voters seeking information about

Bertha’s candidacy are being sent to the three sites identified above, and away from her
legitimate site.

 

Although the true identity of the person or entity purchasing these domain names cannot
be immediately determined because of the cowardly use of private registration, it is clear that
who ever has done so is acting on behalf of the Lindquist campaign. Legal efforts to secure that
data will be forthcoming. As the appointed Prosecutor, you are ultimately responsible for the
actions of your campaign organization and supporters. As the chief lawyer for the Pierce
County, your obligation is to uphold the highest tradition of professionalism and ethics. The
conduct described above, either by commission or omission, fails to meet these standards by any
definition. Moreover, directing those looking for campaign information concerning Ms. Fitzer to

official County sites is equally inappropriate.

Mr. Lindquist, please confirm promptly in writing that you have taken all possible steps
to terminate these activities and to ensure that the offending domain names are being promptly
released. Thank you, gentlemen, for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincer ly,

Steven F. Fitzer

April 13, 2010

Mr. Mark Lindquist

Pierce County Prosecutor
930 Tacoma Ave. S. Rm. 946
Tacoma, WA 98402—2171

Dear Mr. Lindquist:

This letter represents my formal response to the letter of reprimand letter placed in my
file on March 26, 2010. This letter is addressed directly to you as you are the appointing

authority and Ms. Robnett has confirmed that all her acts were done with your permission
and approval.

I have reviewed the materials contained in the investigation file and the supervisor files
of Mary Robnett, Dawn Farina, Denise Greer and Douglas Vanscoy. I do not have access
to my original files, or the files of other deputies other than what appears on the public
LINX site. Therefore, this letter should not to be construed as a full and complete
response to the matters alleged in that document. The materials that I have reviewed to
date, however, establish that the letter of reprimand was placed in my file without
following accepted personnel procedures and without regard to the accuracy of the facts
contained therein. In addition, the standards that are being applied to my cases are not

uniformly enforced. Consequently, it appears that I am being singled out for adverse
treatment.

You and I have had philosophical differences from the start. I am opposed to anyone
who wanted to bring the Piranha Production team to the office to film the life of a certain
leader of the drug team before his latest novel is being published. I am opposed to
turning important public meetings, such as the Law & Justice Commission meeting in

November 2008, into a discussion by a “political pundit” pontificating regarding the
ramifications of the 2008 elections.

I am opposed to anyone who, during a budget crunch, takes his entire management team
to Pacific Beach to discuss “core values,” and then fails to follow those values. I am
opposed to using members of the office as part of my political campaign. Our colleagues
have important work to do. They do not deserve to be in the middle of a campaign.
Because of that, when I announced, I informed each and every member of the office that
they would not be allowed to participate in my campaign in any way and that they should
have no fear if they chose to participate in yours.

I am appalled that the office has the money to convert our human resource manager into
the communication director, but not enough money to make sure our special investigation
unit is staffed at a level sufficient to protect law enforcement and members of this office
from false charges.

I have been vocal regarding many of these and other issues because 1 care deeply about
this office and the people who work here. I believe that all the money we spend in this

office must go directly to the important task of putting sex offenders and other felons in
prison for as long as the law allows.

My passion for justice seems to offend you. After nine years in the Prosecutor’s office,
with many accolades from the former elected prosecutor, clients and members of the
public, I fmd myself confronting written disciplinary action immediately upon the eve of
my announcement that I am going to challenge you in the upcoming election. The
remainder of this letter addresses why that discipline is unwarranted and based on false or
inaccurate information.

Procedural Irregularities

The investigation file reveals that the “referra ” for discipline was made at 1:18 on March
26, 2010. The letter alleges that I failed to meet office expectations regarding the
handling of my felony caseload. I was on vacation that day. The letter was left on my
desk. I discovered it when I arrived back to work on Monday March 29“]. Ms. Stover
sent me an email that day to confirm that I had received it. She confirmed that the letter
had already been placed in my file.

Given our past disputes about your import of partisan politics into this office, it came as
no surprise to me that I was sent to Reman Hall within months of your appointment. I
accepted that assignment without complaint. I was concerned that something would be
constructed regarding my performance, however. I therefore requested access to all
supervisory files in early January, 2010. The contents of those files did not alert me to
the alleged deficiencies.

Mary Robnett’s letter of reprimand arrived ’77 days after my transfer to Reman Hall long
after several of the cases alluded to in the memorandum had been resolved.

I know from my experience defending the County in personnel matters, that other county
departments employ a two step process consistent with sound personnel policies. They
first notify the employee that they intend to take disciplinary action. The employee is
then allowed to present evidence or argument why the contemplated discipline should not
be taken. If the employee’s response is not satisfactory to the department, the discipline
is then imposed. After discipline is imposed, the employee then has further grievance
rights. This give and take process is necessary to protect the employee from false
accusations and to protect the employer in case an allegation of misconduct is unfounded.
Only the most egregious misconduct results in immediate action. Even in those cases,

Page | 2

however, it is common to put the employee on administrative leave pending the outcome
of an official investigation and before discipline is imposed.

Certainly the office’s commitment to “respect" as a core value would have dictated that
this simple, well accepted, personnel process be followed. Had it been followed, I would
have been able to point out a number of serious factual inaccuracies contained in the
allegations. Also, discussion of the issue with me prior to placing the letter in my file
would have allowed me to produce argument and facts which would have seriously
undermined the basis for discipline.

General Denial Regarding Performance in Civil Division

The letter of reprimand refers to “counselings” that allegedly occurred during my tenure
in the Civil Division. The letter states: “While you worked in the Civil Division, you
were counseled by your supervisors regarding your need to better prepare for your cases
after two department directors complained about your lack of preparation in handling
county cases for their departments.” These alleged events date back to the fall of 2003
and 2004. One of the comments is documented in a copy of a client survey I was just
provided as part of Ms. Greer’s file. That survey contains comments from Ms. Sawyers,
Kevin Stock and Steve Wamback.

Ms. Sawyers made a brief comment about the need for better preparation. Her numerical
ratings were high, however. Had I been consulted before the letter was placed in my
personnel file, I could also have provided documentation that my direct clients in both the
personnel matters and the civil service commission hearings were quite pleased about the
results I obtained for them in these hearings.

This fact is substantiated by the comments of my other clients, which are uniformly
positive. Pierce County Clerk Kevin Stock’s wrote:

I have found that the services requested and the resulting product or
information/advice to fully meet my expectations and satisfy the situation
which required assistance. Explanations related to the decision process
have been clear, concise and fully thought-out, expediting implementation
of new policies or procedures, or modifications of existing ones, whenever
necessary.

Steve Wamback, who runs the successful Pierce County Response Team now being
touted in your newsletter, has an even more glowing report. He comments:

Customer/Client satisfaction directly correlates with the expertise and
quality of the services provided. The Solid Waste Division’s increasing
satisfaction with the delivery of legal services is due to the expertise and
quality of Deputy Prosecutors. Bertha Fitzer is the primary attorney
working on Pierce County Responds cases. She’s handled the tough ones
for us: Bachmann, Shear, Gonia, and Christensen. I could not imagine were

Page | 3

we would be without her representation. My only complaint is that I wish
she had more time to assist on our projects. The communigg receives
sig‘ficant benefit from her work. (emphasis added)

My fourth client, Elaine McNally of District Court Probation, did not complete the
survey. Instead she sent an email stating: “Denise—just want to take a minute and tell
you how much we enjoy working with Bertha. She covers the “big picture” as well as
the details, and she’s quick.“

In sum, a fair reading of the documents relating to my performance in the Civil Division,
as documented by the supervisors“ own materials, demonstrates that the reference to
“counselings” regarding trial preparation referred to in this letter were at best isolated
incidents from an early period of my time at this office.

Had I been allowed to respond to this letter before it was placed in my file, I would also
have been able to point out that the information pertaining to the other “complaint” does
not accurately reflect my relationship with the client in question. Both from the
investigation file and from other conversations with Mr. Vanscoy, I am aware that the
other person referred to as a department head who allegedly complained about my
preparation is Sheriff Paul Pastor. This reference goes back to a hearing in 2003 when
Sheriff Pastor had some concern that he voiced through his legal counsel. In 2003, the
Sheriff and I met and discussed this matter. We aired the issue thoroughly and came to
an agreement regarding how to handle our working relationship. I am unaware of any
complaints from him after that date. I have absolutely no hesitancy in referring you to
him for input regarding his opinion of my abilities and my handling of cases before the
Civil Service Commission. I believe his comments will fully support the claim that my
performance met or exceeded his expectations.

 

Mr.Vanscoy”s supervisory file also alludes to his contention that I “bully“ people who
make complaints about me. Mr. Vanscoy writes in an email to himself that “I told Dawn
that I have reason to believe Bertha has gone to clients and county employees who have
expressed concerns about her, once she knew who they were, and essentially bullied
them into disclaiming any problem. (I mentioned Paul to Dawn here, but there was also
a sheriff deputy in the Smith appeal who she went back to as I recall.)”

I suspect that the Sheriff would view the concept that he could be bullied as ludicrous as
I do. I can assure you that I have a healthy respect for anyone who carries a gun and
would not presume to “bully” such an individual or to disrespect the office of Sheriff. I
have great empathy for the sacrifices our law enforcement officials make to defend the
public. Such a tactic on my part would be totally inconsistent with that respect.

Timing of Events Relating to Transfer

I now must address blatant inaccuracies regarding the timing of events mentioned in the
letter of reprimand. The letter falsely states that I was notified of the transfer in
November. The purpose of that claim is to make it look like I had a substantial amount

Page ' 4

of time to prepare my cases for transfer. In reality, I had approximately half that time.
This fact is documented by email correspondence readily available to Ms. Robnett at the
time of the letter of reprimand.

I can establish this fact by reference to three specific emails from December 14 and 15,
2009. In the first email, I alerted Ms. Robnett, Ms. Farina and Mr. Lindquist of my wish
to provide them input regarding the rumored changes to take place in the Arson and
Fraud Team. Ms. Robnett responded on December 15, 2009 saying that you would make
your decision the afternoon of that day. I then spent my lunch hour completing the
analysis. At 1:24 pm I sent an email and attachments documenting my concerns
regarding the siglificant negative impact of Administration’s abrupt decision to
restructure the highly successful and professionally run Arson and Fraud Unit.

Your decision to decimate this unit for no valid reason is truly troubling. The county’s
emails are filled with accolades for the work this team has done under the tutelage of our
office’s most hard working and ethical lawyer, Lisa Wagner. Ms. Wagner is in fact, the
Sheriff Department’s Deputy Prosecutor of the Year. In my memo, I outlined the impact
of the proposed restructuring on the public’s interest in efficient and aggressive
prosecution of these cases. I documented the fact that our unit handled almost three times
the number of felony counts as the other property crime unit and my need to have ready
access to information relating to the DOC project. I asked that my information be given
“full and fair consideration” consistent with the core values of the office. Between 4: 15
and 4:30 that afternoon, I was summarily informed that I would no longer be in the
felony division handling trials.

At the time I was notified, I inquired first and foremost about my cases. I was informed
that those issues would be worked out and that my new unit might have to be without a
deputy for some time during the transition. After, that conversation, I began the process
of trying to identify which cases would be transferred and which I would be allowed to
keep. The move took place on January 8, 2010.

In preparation for transfer of my cases, I prepared transfer memoranda on each major file.
Those memoranda document the status of the case, the recommendation, and provided
the rationale for the recommendations.

0n Januarle, 2010 I requested access to all supervisory files and personnel files. I
inspected those files on January 13, 2010 and requested a complete copy of them. That
copy was provided on or about January 27, 2010, after a repeat request.

On January 19, 2010, I started work at my new assignment. From January 19, 2010 till

March 29, 2010, no supervisor contacted me concerning alleged problems with the files
that had been transferred.

General Response to Allegation of Improper Handling of Felony Cases

Context

During my four years in the felony division, I handled over 400 felony matters. I am an
aggressive and effective trial attorney. I tried 12 matters the first year, 3 the following
year, and 9 each in years three and fourl. In 2009, I was in trial for 55 days. During that
four year period, I also produced the 132 page DOC Report and spent countless hours
volunteering for activities that improved the profession and the community. No case has
been dismissed for want of prosecution, prosecutorial misconduct or discovery violations.
These objective statistics place me near the top of the productivity statistics for the office.

Two of my cases last year made it to your website as significant cases prosecuted by the
office.

Office Policies--Interviewing Witnesses:

The letter of reprimand faults me for not interviewing witnesses. The office policy
manual has no specific guideline regarding interviewing of witnesses. It is my
understanding that the office does not have a verbal policy regarding interviewing
witnesses. It is also my understanding that many of our senior DPA’s do not interview
witnesses before trial because they are concerned that they will become a fact witness in
the case. This approach makes good sense. Most of our cases have the facts documented

in the police reports.

It is my policy to meet with witnesses prior to trial when the defense has requested such
interviews or where I need to seek clarification of some issue raised by the police report.

Other than that, I will meet with witnesses just prior to putting on their testimony. That
tactical approach has served me well in my practice and I believe is consistent with the

approach commonly used in the felony unit. In Team 2 especially, this approach was
necessitated by the substantially more complex cases common in our unit documented in

my memorandum of December 15, 2009.

The arson and explosive cases are a special type of case. They require a strong
understanding of the fire or explosive science and good relations with the experts. I thus

make substantial efforts to remain in constant contact with my experts in the fire and
explosive field. As these are the cases wherein my preparation is being challenged, had

the office extended me the courtesy of an opportunity to respond before disciplinary
action was taken, I would have established that while serving as the arson prosecutor, I

met with the fire investigators on a monthly basis. Much of the discussion regarding their
cases occurred in that informal setting. When an arson case proceeded to trial, I spent

intensive time with the fire investigator and had them prepare power point presentations
so that the jury learned about fire science and the actual fire in a seamless and interesting

presentation. If asked, I could have documented this approach with examples from a
number of my cases.

1 The official numbers for the office are probably off by one. I tried a case just before Thanksgiving that I
forgot to document with a trial report. Quite frankly, I was bummed by my only acquittal of the year.

Page 1 6

Explosive cases also require special expertise. My main contact for the explosive cases
are the experts at ATF. SA Kirk Dennis was frequently in my office discussing all our
open cases, bringing new matters to my attention and offering any and all assistance I
needed to understand the issues in any given fact pattern. He is ready, willing and able to
testify that I prepared my cases in an appropriate fashion, consulted with him frequently
and was responsive to the needs of law enforcement in prosecuting these cases.

Had I been informed of these concerns in a timely fashion, I could have directed Ms.
Robnett to SA Dennis to discuss specifics regarding many of the cases. On April 6,
2010, I contacted SA Dennis to discuss the issues regarding these cases. His comments,
like those of Sheriff Pastor, would n_ot support the conclusion that discipline was
appropriate.

Witness Lists & Subpoenas

There is also no specific policy as to when a witness list is to be filed or subpoenas sent
out. As the issuing of subpoenas creates an expense to the office, I personally do not
subpoena witnesses until such time that it is clear the case is ready for trial. As the
witness list generates the subpoenas, it is therefore not unusual for a file not to have a
formal witness list.

Other deputies may have a less fiscally conservative approach. I generally have a good
idea whether a case is going to proceed to trial and can judge when the need to spend the
money on subpoenas is necessary. Other attorneys may simply issue them without regard
to whether the trial date is a “real” trial date or not.

Rebuttal of Specific Allegations

There are a number of false and inaccurate statements regarding the status of the cases I
transferred. That fact is most clear regarding the case of State v. Terry.

1. State v. Terry: The Dangers of Sloppy Investigation

The letter of reprimand states the following:

Trial Team I received the case of State v. Terry, 09-1-02262-5 on January 4,
2010 and the case was set for trial on February 23, 2010. The case was
arraigned on May 1, 2009. The file contained no witness list and no
witnesses had been subpoenaed. No witness interviews had been conducted.
The allegations involved having to prove the defendant possessed an
explosive device with the intent to use it for “an unlawful purpose.” The
defendant told police he kept the material when he was discharged from the
military. The material was found in a closet while police were looking for a
gun. The case was over 8 months old and there had been no offer made on
the case.

Page | 7

First, the statement that no witnesses were interviewed is false. LINX entries, defense
counsel and Krista Schul of our office all have information that witness interviews of the
chief victim in the case were conducted and that there were attempts to reach the other
three victims. Moreover, as documented in the transfer memorandum, I was in constant
contact with my chief expert in the case, SA Kirk Dennis, and his colleague at ATF. He
obtained additional discovery for me, spoke to the defense attorney regarding the nature
of the explosives in question and participated in preparation and settlement negotiations.

Second, the claim that I had made no offer is false. There were multiple, ongoing
negotiations that occurred informally. Although I do not have the file, I cannot believe
that there was not an official offer conveyed at pretrial as was our unit’s standard
practice.

Third, the claim that “intent” could not be proved is inaccurate. The explosives
possessed by the defendant were stolen from the military and were highly sophisticated
and dangerous devices that no civilian may own. According to my ATF expert, the theft
of the explosives, which are tightly controlled by the military, is an extremely serious
event. The defendant didn’t simply retain a souvenir hand grenade. He had taken
antipersonnel explosive devices and assembled them in such a way as to be readily
exploded. Finally, the incident occurred at Lakeside Landing, a large apartment complex
immediately across from Tacoma Community College and adjacent to St. Charles

Catholic Church and school.

This case was one I had spent substantial time and effort preparing. I knew that, as a war
veteran, the defendant would have substantial sympathy from a jury. My goal therefore
was to get him a felony, and to put into place the maximum amount of protection for the
public. I spent many hours with the defense. I demanded that the defendant be screened
by a mental health professional and that that report be provided to me before any decision
to reduce the charges was made. I reviewed that report and met with counsel again,
pointing out the issues raised in the report. As result of this preparation and negotiation,
I had in place a proposed settlement that I believed took into account the seriousness of
the crime and the risk of trial. I discussed this proposal with my immediate supervisor,
Lisa Wagner.

I sent my proposed resolution to Mary Robnett at 1:40 PM on December 23, 2009 for
approval. I noted in that email that the defendant would probably plead to a Level III,
Incendiary Device charge. I discussed the concept of trading the lower felony for a first
time offender option which would have allowed the court to put him on probation for two
years, order evaluations and treatment and monitor his conduct. Both in that email and in
the transfer memorandum, I documented the substantial public safety concerns presented
by the case which dictated the need for the case to receive appropriate attention and for
the defendant to be supervised. I also documented my concern that given the nature of
the explosive devices and the defendant’s mental health issues, it might be better to hold
firm and demand a plea as charged resolution.

Page | 8

Ms. Robnett informed me that I should make the decision on how the case was to be
resolved. I declined and told her that this was a decision that had to be made by
Administration. Ms. Robnett then asked that I send the file over to her. On December
30, 2009, Ms. Robnett confirmed that she received the lily file. Her email, contained in
the investigation materials, states “I will be handling it.”

Twelve days later, Ms. Ko settled the case at the omnibus hearing. Neither she nor Ms.
Robnett consulted SA Dennis regarding the case even though I specifically directed Ms.
Ko to him in the transfer memo as the person who could give her information regarding
the dangerousness of the military grade explosives in the defendant’s possession. Neither
Ms. Ko nor Ms. Robnett called me back to discuss my recommendation.

On January 20, 2010, Mr. Terry pled to Possession of an Incendiary Device. While the
ultimate felony was the same, the impact on public safety was dramatically different.

Ms. Ko allowed the defendant to plead to the offense without the First Time Offender
Option. Consequently, the most important resource the State had available to it to protect
the public was left out. Her resolution left out community supervision, mental health
evaluations and treatment. The defendant was simply allowed to serve 30 days on
electric home monitoring and then go on his way, apparently with the specific agreement
that the various guns found in his apartment would be returned.

In addition, Ms. Ko’s statement of grounds for amendment contains the inaccurate
statement that there were no victims in the case. LIN X documents that there are four
victims listed. The original charges included an Assault 2 as a result of the defendant’s
pointing a gun at his ex—girlfriend the night the explosives were found. Ms. Ko’s rush to
settle this case resulted in her filing an inaccurate pleading which denied the victims their
right to notice and induced the court’s acceptance of the plea with false information.
Although this conduct may be simply negligence, the fact that the attorney who made this
error is a team leader, and an extremely experienced trial attorney, illustrates that all of us

have competing demands on our time which sometimes produces less than perfect
performance.

Ms. Robnett’s and Ms. Ko’s failure to request the First Time Offender Option, however,
resulted in a potentially dangerous defendant with mental health issues being turned loose
without anything in place to ensure treatment and accountability. This omission violates
our primary duty of handling all of our cases in a manner that ensures public safety.

2. State v. Ripoli: Dealing Away Public Safety

The next case that deserves mention is the persistent offender case of State v. Ripoli. As
to this case, the letter of reprimand states:

Trial Team 1 received the case of State v. Ripoli, 09-1-00044-3 on January

10, 2010 and the trial was set for March 25, 2010. The state had filed a
persistent offender notice alleging that this was the defendant’s third strike.
The file contained on witness list. No subpoenas had been issued.

Page | 9

Certified copies of prior Judgment and Sentence documents have never
been requested. No witnesses had been interviewed, including police
officers. The case involved a significant search issue. The case was over a
year old and no offer had ever been made. Your recommendation of the
transfer memo was that the case proceed to trial on a third strike.

First, once again the comment misrepresents the status of the case. The year that the
case had been pending was spent by the defense trying to convince me and my
immediate supervisor that the matter warranted reduction of charges. The delay was
directly associated with the defense attempts to get documentation and expert support of
their position that this sex offender should be allowed to plead to a non strike offense.
Lisa and I consistently rejected that request because of the significant issues of public
safety documented in the transfer memorandum. I wrote:

This defendant presents with the classic symptoms of those who have
struck out at law enforcement. He apparently harbors great ill will against
law enforcement (especially given his contention that he was not guilty of
the Child Molest), a violent history established by multiple convictions for
assault and a willingness to engage in dangerous activities and to lie to
police as a means of. enticing them into a dangerous situation. We
strongly support litigation of 3rd strike as the most effective way of
ensuring public safety.

This recommendation was based on considerable negotiation, a complete review of the
available mitigation information and analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the case.

This case contains further evidence of the biased and inaccurate characterization of facts
relating to my performance. For instance, contrary to the statement contained in the letter
of reprimand, I had reviewed, considered and rejected the search issue. It is true that
there was no separate research file. I do not normally put copies of the Gant decision in
each file. The transfer memo itself documents that I considered and rejected the defense
search argument and the grounds for my opinion:

The defense has stated that it may have a Gant issue. While a technical
argument might be advanced, it is extremely unlikely that the courts will
accept that argument in the context of the officer’s need to determine if an
explosive device is in the vehicle. Law enforcement officers are not
required to endanger themselves by towing a vehicle that might blow up in
transport. Thus the risk of suppression of the evidence is remote.

I stand by this conclusion, which I formulated after extensive discussions of the issue
with my colleagues. This is a case that could and should have been vigorously
prosecuted in order to protect our law enforcement officers. Instead, within 10 days of
receiving the file, Ms.Ko settled this case stating that the plea held the “defendant
accountable while giving the defendant an opportunity to leave prison sometime later in
life.” [Prosecutor’s Statement Regarding Amended Information dated January 28, 2010].

Page l 10

It is not possible to shift the blame for the resolution of the case on my preparation or
lack thereof. Not only was the search issue weak, there would have been no issue
regarding obtaining certified copies of his prior offenses or the testimony of the officers.
One of the strike offenses had been prosecuted by our office less than two years before
this incident, the other was readily available from Snohomish County.

Full investigation of the prior strike offense committed less than 18 months before this
incident would have illustrated the need to hold firm on this case. This defendant was a
serial abuser. He had beaten his girlh'iend multiple times, in hont of her child. The
Declaration of Probable Cause written by Ms. Ko for that case on August 21, 2007, states
that the defendant first punched his girlfriend in the mouth splitting her lip and then
“grabbed her around the neck with both hands and began squeezing her neck for
approximately 1 minute. She saw “stars” and she felt if her eyes were bulging out of her
hea 3’ The victim impact statement establishes that the assault was not an isolated

incident but a pattern of domestic abuse.

Instead of appreciating what the victim of the prior assault suffered, whoever did the
work up of the grounds for discipline against me, dismisses the 2007 assault with the
statement “Att A2——he strangled his girlfriend for a short time.) Mr. Lindquist: Is this
the level of respect for victims of domestic violence that you support?

There is no question that your team was proud of their quick resolution of this case. The
investigation memorandum touts that the case was resolved quickly and that it was
resolved at the Team 1 offer of “nearly 20 years.” But what deal did this sex offender
really get? He will not be in prison for twenty years. The actual resolution was 17.9
years, not 20. He will get substantial good time credit that will substantially reduce his
time in prison. This sex offender is still a relatively young man. He will thus be out and
about on the streets, with mental health issues, a hatred of cops and women and an ax to
grind. Neither Lisa nor I were willing to place our friends in law enforcement further at
risk by letting a sex offender, who hated cops and abused his women, back out on the

streets. Yet this is precisely what was done.

The letter of reprimand tries to imply that my handling of this and other cases “resulted in
more work for my colleagues and delay in justice for offenders, for victims and for the
community.” Nothing is further from the truth. My handling of my cases put the
community first and foremost. The case would have been simple to try. It required only
the police officers involved. While it is true no witness list was prepared, when I handed
the case over, the new attorney had almost three months to prepare the case. All that was
required was a prosecutor who placed public safety, not backlog reduction, first.

This letter of discipline describes hve class A felony cases I transferred to Team 1. I
would point out, that not or; of the transferred cases resulted in a strike offense for the
defendant. (Although at least the DPA in the Collins case took the matter to trial.) In
contrast, I retained three other similar cases. Within the same period of time, I also
obtained settlements. In one case I forced the defendant to plead guilty as charged to

Pagel 11

Arson in the First Degree. Because he endangered his children, I insisted that he accept
an exceptional sentence which doubled his prison time. In the other case the defendant
pled to two counts of Arson in the First Degree and one count of Reckless Burning. A
third case is currently awaiting a May trial date. In that case, I have rejected the defense
offer to plead guilty as charged because I am insisting on an exceptional sentence. This
is what passionate, tough prosecutors do. We are charged with protecting the public, not
dealing away cases in order to get our numbers below some artificial ceiling.

3. Collins, Constales & Vehul--Disparate Treatment & More Sloppy Investigation

The remaining cases illustrate the double standards applied in this office and the
sloppiness and bias of the instant investigation crafted against me.

As to the Collins case, Ms. Robnett states that “Certified Judgments and Sentences had
never been ordered, but were required to resolve the case.” As documented in the
investigation file and my transfer memorandum, I had in fact ordered the certifieds from
Alaska. I stated specifically: “This case should resolve when an issue regarding the
correct offender score is worked out. Julie Meeks has been tasked with obtaining
certifieds from Alaska to resolve those issues.” Ms. Robnett also does not reveal that
the age of the case was due in part to the defendant’s repeated failure to appear at
hearings. In fact, when the case was eventually tried, two counts of bail jump were
successfully prosecuted.

This case and Verhul also illustrate the double standards being applied in this office.
LINX records indicated that although Team 1 received the file on January 10, 2010, the
witness list and subpoenas were filed and served on February 25, 2010, just eight days
before the scheduled trial date of March 4, 2010. Ms. Lund has had the Verhul case
since January. If the entries on LINX are correct, Ms. Lund has yet to file her witness
list or issue subpoenas although the case has current trial date of April 19, 2010. Are
these deputies being disciplined? Is Ms. Ko going to be reprimanded for filing a false or
inaccurate statement with the court? If not why not? '

The reason is simple. Those of us who have the privilege of trying cases juggle an
incredible work load with lots of stress and little staff assistance. As a private lawyer, I
had resources available to me that shifted the administrative details. But as a
government lawyer, along with the honor of representing the public, comes the reality of
budget crunches, high caseloads and horrific crimes. Each of us chooses a balance that
works. Any other DPA might look at that balance and criticize it. Yet that does not
make the way one deputy handles their cases any better than the other. The bottom line
is what happens to the cases? Are they effectively prosecuted? Do the judges respect
the attorneys? Are the victims provided justice in the end? Applying these standards,
my conduct met or exceeded performance standards of this office.

Conclusion

Given our current adversarial posture, I have little faith that my response to this letter of
reprimand will have any impact on your conduct. Each of the statements contained
herein, however, can be established by reference to a specific document, the case file,
the supervisory files or independent witnesses. I ask that this document accompany the
letter of reprimand. I intend to spend my work day doing my job, preparing my
remaining cases for trial and protecting the public in the way I have done the last nine
years. I also ask that you cease all attempts to interfere with my employment at this
office. Let us turn our attention to the needs of the public, not our own political
concerns.

Dear Bertha,

You are attempting to turn your personal grudges 
into a political agenda. 1 am aware of some of

your previous spats where you escalated your petty 
complaints -- against Judge Elaine Houghton,

against the Pierce County Prosecutors’ 
Association, and now against the colleagues you 
unjustly

attack in your 13 page “formal response” of April 
13th, 2010. Your unjust attack on your

colleagues is the most reprehensible aspect of 
your letter.

As for your view that we have an “adversarial 
posture,“ you created this when you announced your

candidacy after receiving a reprimand for 
mismanagement of your caseload. From the time you 
moved out of Team 11, you likely knew your 
mismanagement would be discovered. I will continue

to treat you fairly as a deputy prosecutor, but 
you are going to be accountable to your 
supervisors, to me, and to the public, consistent 
with our core values.

If you really believed all the charges you made 
and you had the integrity you claim, you would 
move on, but I don’t think you believe all your 
allegations. For example, you know we’ve never

had any “past disputes” about importing “partisan 
politics into the office.” This never happened.

You claim that a “passion for justice” offends me. 
As a member of this office, you should know

that a passion for justice would not offend anyone 
here. What offends people are your false 
allegations, your lack of candor, your lack of 
self-awareness, and your unwillingness to accept

responsibility. If you ever want to be successml 
and happy in this office or any professional 
environment, you will need to be more honest with 
yourself and those you work with. If you treat

your colleagues with respect, they will 
reciprocate.

Chief Criminal Deputy Mary Robnett will respond 
further to your letter. Meanwhile, you would do 
well to quit making excuses, quit your political 
posturing, quit talking about working for the 
public and start actually doing it.

ank you,

1145 Broadway, Ste. 400
Tacoma, WA 98402

Dear Mr. Fitzer:

This is in response to your April 19, 2010 letter to Prosecuting Attorney Mark Lindquist.
We are not at liberty to discuss State v. Veneges or any other pending litigation with you.

Your assertion that Deputy Prosecutor Fitzer previously requested the removal of materials
relating to her recent reprimand is apparently a reference to her 4/3/10 request that the
reprimand be “maintained in a separate file until such time as the grievance process is
complete.” She failed to file a timely grievance, however, and on 4/12/10 she specifically
requested that a 13— —page "written rebuttal. b.e placed in my personnel file along with”
the letter of reprimand Her file now includes both that response and replies by Mr.
Lindquist and Chief Criminal Deputy Mary Robnett. Record retention requirements and
good management practices preclude removal of these documents

Your opinion of Deputy Prosecutor Fitzer’s work performance and work demeanor differs
from that of others. For an accurate and. objective perspective, you can review the letter of
reprimand and the replies of Ms. Robnett and MI. Lindquist. Your suggestion that the
letter of reprimand was in response to Ms. Fitzer‘s speech or campaign activity is baseless.
As Mr. Lindquist previously noted, from the time she moved out of Team 11 she likely
knew her mismanagement would be discovered, and her campaign announcement came
directly after the letter of reprimand. Ms- Fitzer will be treated fairly, like any other
employee, but she will also be held accountable like any other employee. Her decision to
run for office is not a shield against accountability.

Finally, because Ms. Fitzer has formally stated that she does not intend to grieve her
disciplinary action and, in fact, the deadlines for doing so have passed, no need for ”any
future communication concerning these events” that would call for direction of communi—
cations to you as her legal representative is anticipated. However, be advised that as her

Bertha Fitzer

Deputy Prosecuting Attorney

Dear Bertha:

On June 19th at a meeting of the Gig Harbor Republicans you reportedly said that Prosecutor Mark
Lindquist has had 9 of the cases he has tried since 2001 reversed. This is not true.

While people are entitled to their own opinions, dishonesty in deputy prosecutors is unacceptable.

# See Prejudicial PowerPoint Slides Lead to Verdict Reversal

Ely Renee Choy Ohlendorf, Litigation News Associate Editor — April 2?, 2o15

Inflammatory statements the prosecution superimposed on 
photographs previously admitted in evidence sufficiently 
altered the evidence to make the photos inadmissible and 
resulted in reversal of a conviction. In State of 
Washington v. Walker, the prosecution used approximately 
250 PowerPoint slides during closing arguments in the 
murder trial of a defendant accused of orchestrating a 
robbery. Several of the slides included photographs 
admitted into evidence but altered with inflammatory 
captions and superimposed text.

## The Prejudieial Slides

One photograph of money seized by police was 
superimposed with the heading, “MONEY 15 MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN HUMAN LIFE," though those words 
were not used in testimony. Another slide 
contained a photo of the victim superimposed with 
the heading, “DEFENDANT'S GREED AND CALLOUS 
DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE” and with text describing 
the distribution of the stolen proceeds among the 
robbery participants. A photo of the defendant and 
his family eating a lobster dinner following the 
robbery was captioned, “THIS 15 HOW YOU MURDER AND 
ROB N 5, NEXT TIME IT WILL BE MORE MONEY," an 
admissible statement attributed to Walker. 
Further, Walker’s booking photograph was altered 
with the caption, “WE ARE GOING TO BEAT THIS,” 
another admitted statement attributed to Walker. 
Over 100 of the prosecution's slides stated that 
Walker was “GUILTY" in bright red lettering. One 
series of slides suggested Walker was guilty 
because he used the money to purchase video games 
and lobster.

Walker's counsel failed to object to the slides, 
and the jury convicted him on all charges. Walker 
appealed on the grounds of prosecutorial 
misconduct, improper jury instructions, and 
ineffective assistance of counsel. The Washington 
Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions.

##Prosecutor Crossed the Llne

The Washington Supreme Court unanimously reversed 
the conviction and remanded the case for a new 
trial due to prosecutorial misconduct. Generally, 
a defendant “has the burden of showing the 
prosecutor's conduct was both improper and 
prejudicial in the context of the entire trial,” 
and must also show that an instruction would not 
have cured the prejudice if raised for the first 
time on appeal, according to the court.

Multimedia resources and visual aids can and 
should be used in closing arguments to help the 
jury understand the evidence and issues, but the 
slides in this case “served no legitimate purpose" 
and “obfuscated the complicated facts" in this 
case, the majority opined. The prosecution’s 
addition of inflammatory captions and text to 
admitted exhibits constituted the presentation of 
altered evidence to the jury, according to the 
majority. The majority also held that the 
additional text violated Oregon Rule of 
Professional Conduct 3.4(e), which prohibits 
expression of personal opinion on the defendant's 
guilt, and found the sheer volume of improper 
slides presumptively prejudicial. The court 
suggested trial judges preview attorneys’ 
PowerPoint presentations to the jury to avoid 
future retrial.

## Race Improperly Highlighted

The concurring justices—noting that many of the 
PowerPoint slides presented “actual quotations 
from or portions of photos from properly admitted 
evidence, or both," and were thus “fair game 
during closing"—found the use of altered evidence 
to be less pervasive than the majority. The 
concurrence focused instead on the prosecutor’s 
improper emphasis on race, observing that even if 
admitted into evidence, presenting exhibits and 
testimony in a fashion unfairly emphasizing a 
defendant’s race is impermissible.

The concurring judges reasoned that an admitted 
statement containing the “n-word," when combined 
with an admitted photo depicting the defendant 
eating a lobster dinner with his family, 
essentially “altered " the photo because the 
“n-word" stressed defendant's race. Similarly, the 
concurrence found that the defendant's booking 
photo was “doubly altered” when captioned with the 
defendant's statement, “We are going to beat 
this." The prosecutor excised the booking photo 
from a photo lineup that was admitted into 
evidence, and superimposed on it the defendants 
quote. The concurrence noted that standing alone 
and unaltered, presentation of these two items of 
evidence at closing would have been proper. But 
when presented together, the prosecutor 
impermissibly emphasized the defendant's race, 
where racial motive was either alleged or 
relevant.

##Proper versus Improper Slides

ABA Section of Litigation leaders agree that 
reversal was proper. “There was no way to separate 
the outcome from the conduct of the prosecutor," 
says Dawn Du Verney, Philadelphia, PA, cochair of 
the Section of Litigation's Criminal Litigation 
Committee. “The prosecutor not only presented the 
evidence, but usurped the jury's role as trier of 
fact by telling the jurors how to think about the 
evidence and what to conclude as well,” she 
explains.

“Demonstrative pieces used during closings are 
supposed to summarize facts and evidence, but the 
evidence was peppered with opinion and argument. 
The concern is that the jury would be confused as 
to what is actually evidence versus what is 
actually the prosecutor's argument," states D. 
Grayson Yeargin, Washington, D.C., cochair of the 
Sections Civil Rights Litigation Committee. The 
prosecution may have also overreached into the 
jury's role by captioning photos with witness 
testimony, according to Yeargin. “It's for the 
jury to connect the dots between the pieces of 
evidence, and by presenting evidence in that way, 
the jury could be misled into thinking those two 
things must be linked in the evidence," observes 
Yeargin.

The Waiker court did not draw a bright line 
governing the content of PowerPoint slides, but 
Section leaders agree that a key criterion is 
whether the visual aid helps or confuses the 
jurors. “The demarcation line is where you cross 
the line of advocacy into confusion. That's when 
the courts get involved and it should be stopped," 
opines Yea rgin.

Trial attorneys are advised to skip the theatrics, 
to be mindful to present only admitted evidence, 
and to present admitted evidence in an evenhanded 
way. “Anything that is on the edge, you may just 
want to artfully allude to it," recommends Du 
Verney.
