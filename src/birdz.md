That's Yao in the morning getting cleaned up.

So tender, Yao songbird.

This is P and her sister. (P is the smaller one.)

Her sister does not like Yao and tries to keep them apart:(

And she almost falls for it!

But Yao's giggles pierce her heart. So good!

Plus he brings her worms and delicious seeds every day. They go swimming a lot. They have good adventures.
