# SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF A PROSECUTOR


The prosecutor in a criminal case shall:
	
(a)  refrain from prosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probable cause;
	
(b)  make reasonable efforts to assure that the accused has been advised of the right to, and the procedure for
obtaining, counsel and has been given reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel;

(c)  not seek to obtain from an unrepresented accused a waiver of important pretrial rights, such as the right
to a preliminary hearing;

(d)  make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends
to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the
defense and to the tribunal all mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecutor is
relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal;

(e)  not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal proceeding to present evidence about a past or
present client unless the prosecutor reasonably believes:

(1)  the information sought is not protected from disclosure by an applicable privilege;

(2)  the evidence sought is essential to the successful completion of an ongoing investigation or prosecution; and

(3)  there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the information;

(f)  except for statements that are necessary to inform the public of the nature and extent of the prosecutor's
action and that serve a <mark>legitimate law enforcement purpose, refrain from making extrajudicial comments that
have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused</mark> and exercise reasonable care to
prevent investigators, law enforcement personnel, employees or other persons assisting or associated with the
prosecutor in a criminal case from making an extrajudicial statement that the prosecutor would be prohibited
from making under Rule 3.6 or this Rule.

(g)  When a prosecutor knows of new, credible and material evidence creating a reasonable likelihood that a
convicted defendant is innocent of the offense of which the defendant was convicted the prosecutor shall:

(1)  promptly disclose that evidence to an appropriate court or authority, and

(2)  if the conviction was obtained in the prosecutor's jurisdiction,

(A)  promptly disclose that evidence to the defendant unless a court authorizes delay, and

(B)  make reasonable efforts to inquire into the matter, or make reasonable efforts to cause the appropriate law
enforcement agency to undertake an investigation into the matter.

(h)  [Reserved.]

(i)  A prosecutor's independent judgment, made in good faith, that the evidence is not of such nature as to
trigger the obligations of paragraph (g) of this Rule, though subsequently determined to have been erroneous,
does not constitute a violation of this Rule.

##    Comment

[1]  [Washington Revision.] A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice and not simply that
of an advocate. This responsibility carries with it specific obligations to see that the defendant is accorded
procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence. The extent of mandated
remedial action is a matter of debate and varies in different jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions have adopted the
ABA Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function, which in turn are the product of
prolonged and careful deliberation by lawyers experienced in both criminal prosecution and defense. Competent
representation of the government may require a prosecutor to undertake some procedural and remedial measures
as a matter of obligation.  Applicable law may require other measures by the prosecutor and knowing disregard
of those obligations or a systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion could constitute a violation of Rule 8.4.

[Comment amended effective December 13, 2011.]

[2]  In some jurisdictions, a defendant may waive a preliminary hearing and thereby lose a valuable
opportunity to challenge probable cause. Accordingly, prosecutors should not seek to obtain waivers of
preliminary hearings or other important pretrial rights from unrepresented accused persons. Paragraph (c) does
not apply, however, to an accused appearing pro se with the approval of the tribunal. Nor does it forbid the
lawful questioning of an uncharged suspect who has knowingly waived the rights to counsel and silence.
	
[3]  The exception in paragraph (d) recognizes that a prosecutor may seek an appropriate protective order
from the tribunal if disclosure of information to the defense could result in substantial harm to an individual or
to the public interest.

[4]  Paragraph (e) is intended to limit the issuance of lawyer subpoenas in grand jury and other criminal
proceedings to those situations in which there is a genuine need to intrude into the client-lawyer relationship.

[5]  Paragraph (f) supplements Rule 3.6, which prohibits extrajudicial statements that have a substantial
likelihood of prejudicing an adjudicatory proceeding. In the context of a criminal prosecution, a prosecutor's
extrajudicial statement can create the additional problem of increasing public condemnation of the accused.
Although the announcement of an indictment, for example, will necessarily have severe consequences for the
accused, a prosecutor can, and should, avoid comments which have no legitimate law enforcement purpose and
have a substantial likelihood of increasing public opprobrium of the accused. Nothing in this Comment is
intended to restrict the statements which a prosecutor may make which comply with Rule 3.6(b) or 3.6(c).

[6]  Like other lawyers, prosecutors are subject to Rules 5.1 and 5.3, which relate to responsibilities
regarding lawyers and nonlawyers who work for or are associated with the lawyer's office. Paragraph (f)
reminds the prosecutor of the importance of these obligations in connection with the unique dangers of
improper extrajudicial statements in a criminal case. In addition, paragraph (f) requires a prosecutor to exercise
reasonable care to prevent persons assisting or associated with the prosecutor from making improper
extrajudicial statements, even when such persons are not under the direct supervision of the prosecutor.
Ordinarily, the reasonable care standard will be satisfied if the prosecutor issues the appropriate cautions to law-
enforcement personnel and other relevant individuals.


##  Additional Washington Comments [7]-[10]

[7]  [Washington revision.]  When a prosecutor knows of new, credible and material evidence creating a
reasonable likelihood that a person outside the prosecutor's jurisdiction was convicted of a crime that the person
is innocent of committing, paragraph (g) requires prompt disclosure to the court or other appropriate authority,
such as the chief prosecutor of the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred.  If the conviction was obtained in
the prosecutor's jurisdiction, paragraph (g) requires the prosecutor to make reasonable efforts to inquire into the
matter to determine whether the defendant is in fact innocent, or make reasonable efforts to cause the
appropriate law enforcement agency to undertake an investigation into the matter.

[8]  [Reserved.]

[9]  [Reserved.]  Comment [9] to Model Rule 3.8 is codified, with minor revisions, as paragraph (i).

[10]  In many of the Lawyer RPC, the term "counsel" has been changed to "lawyer" to avoid ambiguity between a
lawyer and an LLLT.  The term "counsel" has been retained in this Rule, however, because this term in a criminal
matter may implicate statutory and constitutional responsibilities that are not intended to be modified.  The term
"counsel" in this Rule nevertheless denotes a lawyer.
