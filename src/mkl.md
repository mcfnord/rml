# Mary Key LeTourneau

The topic [Mary Kay LeTourneau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kay_Letourneau)
contains the following errors:

* Article subject's name is Mary Fualauu. Source confirms that's her name, but [John from Ergowon reverts it]() if 
you fix it. So article subject is victim of tabloid re-naming, enforced by John from Ergowon.
* Not sex in car.
* Not student on arrest.

The topic would benefit from these improvements:

* Titling as _Crime and consequences_, rather than _Crime, Judgement and 
Sentencing_.

# Entrenched belligerants prevent fixing these errors

Two editors vandalize all fixes, and pretend to not understand
the rules about BLPs are being violated. They perpetuate those
violations.

# Irony

One person said primary sources can violate privacy. This BLP violates an individual's right against
accusations! Primary sources, and proper reading of secondary sources, dispute these salacious claims.
The subject is offering primary sources. How ironic it is to avoid these yet defend telling these lies.

# BLP

I had thought Wikipedia was serious about their BLP rules. But they aren't. When a mob craves the salacious
facets, they advocate for them, BLP rules be damned!

Every editor so far who has opposed the fixes has described rules far different from
[the actual rules governing BLPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons).
It's just good to read it, and study it, and accept what it says, because _you will swim against
strong currents that apparently can't read the BLP rules_.



After considerable acriminonious and unproductive debate, I'm asserting that strict BLP rules that govern living 
people compel me to elide thesse claims in this BLP. These three claims are false, or it's reasonable to believe they 
could well be false, which is adequate cause to remove them from this BLP:

 

1) sex in car

2) age 12

3) student

 

The most cogent argument defending these claims is that we present them here based on WP:UNDUE, i.e. it would be a 
violation of WP:UNDUE to omit them. For a non-BLP, this would be right, but WP:UNDUE does not apply to salacious 
claims about living people, most notably involving claims around crimes.

 

The arguments defending this change are not basic Wikipedia, and deserve clear presentation. As well, the arguments 
for each differ in important ways:

 

1) Sex in car is claimed in many outlets of typically-reliable sources. However, the claim is refuted by all primary 
sources, and is refuted by evidence presented in reliable sources. To refute is more than to dispute, because a 
refutation includes evidence. Had the current claim also included evidence (such as a police report describing 
finding a naked couple in coitus in the car, or even smells suggesting this), that would be a different matter.

 

2) Age 12 is, for the sake of argument, as well-represented in typically reliable sources as age 13 is. Little more 
than this is known to me, though primary sources might be interesting. The BLP principle that resolves this is purely 
the nature of conservative prose. Unlike WP:UNDUE that would make room for both claims for matters outside 
consequential claims about living people, Wikipedia publishes 13 because it's the most conservative claim 
substantiated by reliable sources. As an alternative, we could say "widely reported as 12 or 13" as that's 
conservative prose that isn't making a claim, but is reporting the claim of others. Anyone seeking that route would 
need to examine primary sources, else those are just weasel words. I'm willing to examine that with serious 
investigators. Currently we state as a matter of fact the age 13, and that's consistent with conservative writing 
rules as the most conservative substantiated claim.

 

3) The child in the car was a former student. This is much like #1, where many sources make the more salacious claim, 
but those that provide evidence contradict the current-student status. But it's also like #2 where the most 
conservative substantiated claim prevails. Because it pertains to a BLP, and especially to a crime, the most 
conservative substantiated claim must prevail.

 

In all three cases I'm somewhat open to explaining that the less-likely claims were widely reported. I think that 
would also represent conservative writing in this unusual (tabloid) scenario. These are precisely the cases where we 
must increase skepticism to the claims of typically-reliable sources. But I find it more useful to zero in on those 
secondary reliable sources that provide evidence, and remain concerned that the evidence provided doesn't just 
dispute, but fully refutes the more salacious claims. I haven't added primary sources to the case, but strongly 
suspect they do the same thing.

 

I understand this controversy involves some key Wikipedia principles, including WP:UNDUE and WP:TRUTH. But it hinges 
on fundamental rules of BLPs. While I remain open to persuasion that I'm mistaken, I've removed the salacious claims 
listed above, and replaced each with prose I consider conservative. In the case of the car discovery, I provided 
'''all''' the details, and invite concision for those who wish to participate. Despite claims made to the contrary on 
my own talk page, this is not an assertion of authority over this page, but is an insistence that BLPs only includes 
conservative claims about living people.


Has asserted that I "empathize too much" with the subject. Conservative writing is not about empathy, but about 
claims. Claims we can prove, and prove the strongest. There's an error pervading this debate that BLPs cover 
conflicting claims just the same way the rest of Wikipedia does. Not true. The consequence of this error, which many 
seem to defend, is that immodest, unconservative claims prevail.

 

It has turned my stomach. Who are these people who can't read the very clear foundation of BLP authoring? And why are 
we letting them endanger Wikipedia for their misguided crusade? I am concerned about anti-BLP thinking and mobs who 
swarmed on this BLP and probably others where certain hot-button issues are covered. You should be concerned, too.

 

If we can't handle these basics on controversial living people, we should not cover controversial living people.

 

I want to unite with people committed to conservative writing on BLPs to either win these battles with the mobs, or 
stop publishing allegedly-factual information about living people on Wikipedia. Fix it or burn it down!

 

Is there a legal-related noticeboard? Is there a noticeboard where immodest claims about living people are the focus? 
Nobody here seems to care about the core foundation of BLP claims. Some active here think we treat claims about 
criminality just like claims about Pluto being a planet. It turns my stomach, because under the banner of "due 
weight" they defend unconservative claims. It has to stop. And apparently that means uniting with people to stop it. 
Please help me defeat this small mob and finish this BLP.


# Endless attacks

I guess what's going on is endless threats of official sanction. I need to do what's right for this
BLP and every BLP. If the system doesn't value conservative writing, perhaps it will block me?
That's when I'll know the BLP rules are a joke and victims of tabloid journalism can be re-victimized
here forever. 

I totally want to collect instances where Wikipedia slanders. It's fascinating to me.


# Narcissistic Abuse

I've been abused by a narcissist before. It's a lot like this. Every stunt they're pulling,
they blame you for pulling. Until you start acknowledging their supremacy, they will never stop
attacking. Maybe not a great source for collaborative success.
