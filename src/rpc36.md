# TRIAL PUBLICITY

(a)  A lawyer who is participating or has participated in the investigation or litigation of a matter <mark>shall not
make an extrajudicial statement that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know will be disseminated by means of
public communication and will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding
in the matter.</mark>

(b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a lawyer may state:

(1)  the claim, offense or defense involved and, except when prohibited by law, the identity of the
persons involved;

(2)  information contained in a public record;

(3)  that an investigation of a matter is in progress;

(4)  the scheduling or result of any step in litigation;

(5)  a request for assistance in obtaining evidence and information necessary thereto;

(6)  a warning of danger concerning the behavior of a person involved, when there is reason to believe that
there exists the likelihood of substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest; and

(7)  in a criminal case, in addition to subparagraphs (1) through (6):

(i)  the identity, residence, occupation and family status of the accused;

(ii)  if the accused has not been apprehended, information necessary to aid in apprehension of the person;

(iii)  the fact, time and place of arrest; and

(iv)  the identity of investigating and arresting officers or agencies and the length of the investigation.

(c)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a lawyer may make a statement that a reasonable lawyer would believe
is required to protect a client from the substantial undue prejudicial effect of recent publicity not initiated by
the lawyer or the lawyer's client. A statement made pursuant to this paragraph shall be limited to such information
as is necessary to mitigate the recent adverse publicity.

(d)  No lawyer associated in a firm or government agency with a lawyer subject to paragraph (a) shall make
a statement prohibited by paragraph (a).

## Comment

[1]  It is difficult to strike a balance between protecting the right to a fair trial and safeguarding the right of
free expression. <mark>Preserving the right to a fair trial necessarily entails some curtailment of the information that
may be disseminated about a party prior to trial, particularly where trial by jury is involved.</mark> If there were no
such limits, the result would be the practical nullification of the protective effect of the rules of forensic
decorum and the exclusionary rules of evidence. On the other hand, there are vital social interests served by the
free dissemination of information about events having legal consequences and about legal proceedings
themselves. The public has a right to know about threats to its safety and measures aimed at assuring its
security. It also has a legitimate interest in the conduct of judicial proceedings, particularly in matters of general
public concern. Furthermore, the subject matter of legal proceedings is often of direct significance in debate and
deliberation over questions of public policy.

[2]  Special rules of confidentiality may validly govern proceedings in juvenile, domestic relations and
mental disability proceedings, and perhaps other types of litigation. Rule 3.4(c) requires compliance with such rules.

[3]  The Rule sets forth a basic general prohibition against a lawyer's making statements that the lawyer
knows or should know will have a <mark>substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding</mark>.
Recognizing that the public value of informed commentary is great and the likelihood of prejudice to a
proceeding by the commentary of a lawyer who is not involved in the proceeding is small, the Rule applies only
to lawyers who are, or who have been involved in the investigation or litigation of a case, and their associates.

[4]  Paragraph (b) identifies specific matters about which a lawyer's statements would not ordinarily be
considered to present a substantial likelihood of material prejudice, and should not in any event be considered
prohibited by the general prohibition of paragraph (a). Paragraph (b) is not intended to be an exhaustive listing of
the subjects upon which a lawyer may make a statement, but statements on other matters may be subject to paragraph (a).

[5]  There are, on the other hand, certain subjects that are more likely than not to have a material prejudicial
effect on a proceeding, <mark>particularly when they refer to</mark> a civil matter triable to a jury, <mark>a criminal matter, or any
other proceeding that could result in incarceration</mark>. These subjects relate to:

(1)  the character, credibility, reputation or criminal record of a party, suspect in a criminal investigation
or witness, or the identity of a witness, or the expected testimony of a party or witness;

(2)  in a criminal case or proceeding that could result in incarceration, the possibility of a plea of guilty
to the offense or the existence or contents of any confession, admission, or statement given by a defendant or
suspect or that person's refusal or failure to make a statement;

(3)  the performance or results of any examination or test or the refusal or failure of a person to submit to
an examination or test, or the identity or nature of physical evidence expected to be presented;

(4)  any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of a defendant or suspect in a criminal case or proceeding that
could result in incarceration;

(5)  information that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is likely to be inadmissible as evidence in a
trial and that would, if disclosed, create a substantial risk of prejudicing an impartial trial; or

(6)  the fact that a defendant has been charged with a crime, unless there is included therein a statement
explaining that the charge is merely an accusation and that the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless
proven guilty.

[6]  Another relevant factor in determining prejudice is the nature of the proceeding involved. <mark>Criminal jury
trials will be most sensitive to extrajudicial speech</mark>. Civil trials may be less sensitive. Non-jury hearings and
arbitration proceedings may be even less affected. The Rule will still place limitations on prejudicial comments
in these cases, but the likelihood of prejudice may be different depending on the type of proceeding.

[7]  [Washington revision]  Finally, extrajudicial statements that might otherwise raise a question under this
Rule may be permissible when they are made in response to statements made publicly by another party, another
party's lawyer or LLLT , or third persons, where a reasonable lawyer would believe a public response is
required in order to avoid prejudice to the lawyer's client. When prejudicial statements have been publicly made
by others, responsive statements may have the salutary effect of lessening any resulting adverse impact on the
adjudicative proceeding. Such responsive statements should be limited to contain only such information as is
necessary to mitigate undue prejudice created by the statements made by others.
