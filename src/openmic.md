# Nuts and bolts

Perhaps I'd love a vague but emotionally expressive show for you. My feelings motivated what I'm going to tell you, but this is a nuts and bolts presentation.
It was an unusual experience where I played a part only I could play.
But maybe I have some tips and conclusions that can empower you. 

# Where’s my head at?

After my partner died, I was completely broken. But I had a vision. And maybe after 5 years, I'm halfway to my vision.
I won't explain now what the whole vision is, but I will tell you some design principles. I used to be one kind of cyborg, and set out to be another kind.
I knew some changes could make me much more powerful.

## Re-invent to find the extreme power of simple things

I wanted to be unnaturally empowered.
I am a person of some extremes. I call myself a "data anaorexic". I decided in 2015 to fuse myself to some nerdy facts, to cast my lot with the masses, to 
wonder what tools can empower an African villager as well as Bill Gates. I took on a Buddhist monk's thoughts about technology: If it disappears, can I go 
without? If some things break, what things don't? If I can always do things one way, but not another, why learn the other way at all?
I wanted to build using such pure tools and techniques that I could do huge things, because I can do their simple parts perfectly.
I wanted a way to share words so simply, so I could simply share hundreds of thousands of words, simply.
I threw away my Windows and re-invented my tools using Android and Linux in a cloud.
I asked how I can run the show on two large tablets at 
home, and seamlessly pick up during a bus ride.
RIght there with a suction cup annd battery mount.
A sleek keyboard going non-stop across every computer 
in my life. Then I can scale up and down through the 
day.
Then I'm always present. Later, people asked why
it seemed like I was always online.

As a data anaorexic at 1988 internet speeds, there's a lot of the internet I can't view. It's by design, but it makes me an ascetic, with fewer distractions
and fewer options of what I can do. If I can't do it with simple tools, I probably won't do it.

## Find strength in what others may see as weaknesses

It's a long damn story, but in 2003, i started working while laying flat. It's not simple. I basically want to use computers in a way none of them are 
designed to support. I need to make tablets and monitors float over my face while I lay flat. I solved this problem with off-the-shelf parts and lots of trial 
and error. The consequence is: Even as I drift off to sleep, I'm exposed to that thing I call My Platform. At home I found a breakthrough in 2017, a children's
swing made from 4x4's, with clamps, bars, and magnets to hold tablets and phones right above my laying body, where my hands can reach and eyes can see them.

# New Year’s 2015

(Because it was a trial, I can read from trial testimony about what happened.)

Seven words probably shouldn't trigger a speech crime trial. You might disagree. A tweet-length statement just doesn't seem like enough cause to trigger a trial.
But I'm not here to tell you about my trial, and the laws, and the Supreme Court's involvement while I was on bail. I will tell you that political forces
prevented the prosecutor from dropping the matter. Instead, he took me to trial.

# The Media Machine

I will call him my adversary. He's not my enemy, or foe. But we met in adversarial conflict in court, and then we met again in adversarial conflict in the court of public opinion.
I defeated my adversary in both arenas. That says something, beccause like me, he's a unique animal.

Many said he thrived on being a loud voice in a small media market. Maybe Tacoma has one television transmitter. I don't remember. Seattle rules the airwaves. 
He built up a pattern with an FM news channel, preparing moralizing or witty quips about each crime he prosecuted. He'd be on the local podcast. He'd appear 
in a picture with the local cartoonist. He'd hire Sonics Man to do his public events. He hired a former news reporter to "shape impressions" for a six-figure 
salary, putting out press releases in print-anything coupon newspapers throughout the county. Let me read three paragraphs from the last one he published, 
right before the election:

<ul>“Our Elder Abuse team is a leader in the state for 
protecting vulnerable adults,” said Prosecutor Mark 
Lindquist. “Protecting the most vulnerable among us is 
a top priority.”

On November 13, 2017, Buckley Police were dispatched 
to the Rainier State School in Buckley in response to 
a report of a male staff member having sex with a 
female adult client at the school. The school is a 
habilitation center for individuals with developmental 
disabilities.

Police spoke with Hunter Shear, an attendant counselor 
at the facility. She told police Terry Shepard is her 
supervisor. Ms. Shear was trying to find Shepard to 
ask him if she could go on a break. Shear said she 
found Shepard in a client’s room.

The client is M.S., 57, a non-verbal autistic adult 
with an estimated mental age of eight. Ms. Shear said 
when she arrived at M.S.’s room, she saw Shepard with 
his back to the door and his pants and underwear down 
around his knees. Ms. Shear said Shepard had M.S.’s 
legs pinned up to her chest and was making back and 
forth movements like he was having sex with her. M.S. 
was on the bed on her back. Ms. Shear said she 
startled Shepard when coming in the room and he turned 
around to face her with his genitals exposed.

Lindquist formed his specialized Elder Abuse Unit in 
2011. Three years ago, the unit won an award of nearly 
$400,000.00 from the Department of Justice for a 
comprehensive approach to prosecuting and preventing 
the abuse of vulnerable adults.</ul>


He spent a lot of tax money to shape people's 
impressions of him. And the whole pipeline just 
worked. The local coupon papers appreciated the column 
inches, about crimes, about justice, always with the 
money quote from the prosecutor about right and wrong.

Stacy 
said people looked at her funny when she would share her conclusion that the guy has to go. His PR work did pay off. He reached nearly iconic status in name 
recognition. And his challenger was an unknown.

I concluded early on that someone who is well-known won't be forgotten. The only possible shift is to move 
people to dislike them. Yes, they'll recognize the name, and it will make them mad.

While I was on bail awaiting trial, brave, busy people mounted a recall 
campaign.

I don't want you to think I sought and found revenge. I can't get revenge. It's not a savory thought to me. I saw something wrong and I fixed it.
There are details about my experience that seem unbelievable to me. Before my verdict: The day before my verdict, I sat 20 feet from him, looking right at 
him, at a fundraiser for the Democratic party. My parents said I mustn't speak to him, and I didn't. I snuck outside into smoke joints in the cold night. My 
anxiety was off the chart.

## Some native son

My adversary's middle name is Evans. His great-uncle is Dan Evans, a respected Washington governor from my childhood. His mom was a respected activist for the rights of
people who have disabilities to get a public school education. Her advocacy went nation-wide after Congress adopted her state legislation that her uncle Dan signed into law here.
Her father was a well-known leader in education, as was his twin brother.
My adversary's childhood best friend is the current governor of our state. While a young man, he dated Molly Ringwald. He wrote four novels, accomplishing recognition among
a 90's literary crew. He rose to power as a young prosecutor, appointed by a retiring prosecutor, elected twice, without credible opposition.

Many investigative reporter news articles about him quoted people who refused to be identified out of fear for their careers.

I spoke with a policewoman who asked him probing questions the day he came to get the police union's endorsement.
She saw him behind a glass divider, pointing toward her, and demanding the Chief of Police take some action.
She said people in her union suggested they endorse him because it's too scary to imagine opposing him.
He liked to smear, and end careers, and banish people to bad posts for disagreeing with him. I read the declarations of people whose careers he ended out of spite.
I read declarations about a woman he imprisoned for 8 months without evidence. I heard she lost her children to adoption. Eight months is so much sorrow.

Some native son.

## Oh look, it's me on TV

And I was fodder for the media machine.

There are rules that govern attorney appearances on television, but this attorney sought to break those rules, and had an explanation that
he's doing the people's work in some fashion. Just after the elecction, he was formally admonished for his radical technique, but in 2015 he was going strong with it.

A musicc video with sexy violence plus an interview with a prosecutor made the television news really exciting that night.

## Not guilty

I remember thinking once while I testified, "Why is he doing this? Doesn't he know it's not smart?" My adversary caused hardship to my family and me. I already
had visions of mad power through viral tools. I wasn't clear how it would matter, but felt a trajectory.
i
## Paper tigers, real teeth

The top lawyer in the county had a team of 100 lawyers working for him. That's got to be some kind of extreme environment. These people know how to
persuade, and how to evade. Their leader probably knows these tricks well.

One whistleblower lawyer told me his straightforward view that mental illness, in particular malignant narcissism, was the operative explanation of everything.
I have some experience with such people. They will destroy those who get in their way.
My family cautioned me many times that I was messing with dangerous people. I know. I already lost my child, so what else are you going to take away?
I was already committed to lampooning on Twitter, so why not go the whole way? I'd regret seeing 4 more years because a small number of votes kept him in office.
I was all-in.

# Lots and lots of groundwork

My step-mother told me early on that my adversary might be unacccustomed to the amount of sustained focus and effort I can give to a cause.
In 2015 I was diagnosed with a mild autism. I haven't come to grips with what that means, but it explains a few things about me, and does put me in
a different category. I can sustain a focus for a long time. Maybe that was something new for my adversary.

I remember exactly one year before the vote, I registered an internet domain PIERCEJUSTICE.INFO. Before that year was up, I was referring to
"The Pierce Justice organization". Pierce Justice eventually endorsed people, and critically, hosted easy-to-read legal documents and letters
that showed the hypocracy and unjust behavior of both my adversary and his cronies.

# Kitchen sink, no plan

One principle I stuck with is to remain a petrey dish for new ideas. Try a new kind of tweet.
Talk to an elected official in tweets. Write a picture essay. Paste hearts on the challenger.
Make up positive memes. Surround my adversary's frustrated fans with love. Raise morale,
raise morale, raise morale. Cheer everyone on. Put words on pictures. Write an essay.j
Copy opposition persuasion and repurpose it. Call out jerks. Throw a link but always stay
present and receptive as a speaker. Let people disagree.

## Laugh him out of office

In 2015, before my criminal trial, I started tweeting as a fake version of my adversary.
It was great therapy for me, facing trial and over a year in prison for a seven word speech crime.
The experience of being strongly cautioned to remain silent doesn't suit my personality.
I remain loud. You remain silent if you want. I needed an outlet where I could begin
the psueodoanonymous lampooning of the naked emporer. It took a long time to get a style,
and styles changed.

# His "campaign"

I had a palatte of tools. I could make a link to a document. I could toss it in a comment. So 
misinformation could be confronted immediately, where it lives. After my adversary lost the 
primary, he mass emailed a link to a false and insane rant a local goon had written. The local 
website, Tacoma Weekly, kind of prints anything. Since my comment on his rant had a link, I saw 
traffic spike. Six hurs later, the owner of the Tacoma Weekly took the campaign down. Later, in 
response to the use of disinformation, members of the Tacoma City Council quietly informed my 
adversary that he couldn't engage in that kind of campaigning if he wished to keep their 
endorsement. He fairly noted that left him few options, because his actual record had such serious 
concerns.

## Wikipedia

I evoked a doxing.

As recently as December, I was doxed on the platform. The violator took pains to spell out my name, including my middle initial.

## Bigger stick

I had concluded that a media creep needed to face a stronger media force. There are strong parallels with our Presidential disinformation woes. I'd explain 
that we need to give people the facts, as an antidote to the lies.

So my machine had many moving parts, and they all took on a synergy together. My mentor said I made it look so easy, delivering a tweet that made ya laugh, 
connected to an original document that made you mad. I ran the server, so I could watch the impact in the server's logs. I could craft a joke as the 
pseudo-anonymous Twitter persona, and also share more serious details as my Facebook self, not joking at all. I could share a super-clean document with 
highlights not found in the original PDF. I reached people. People shared links. Memes I made in 2015 re-appeared organically in 2018. And through routine 
monitoring, I then shared their new details within the system.

Instead I can tell you how these events transformed me, and turned me into a persuasive actor in a ballot question.
Everything is so meta now. That's the problem these days. What I say now is so often about what I said then. "So I says to him, so I says to him, so I 
says..." The brawls of public opinion are punched in tweets now.
Mobs are still mobs. Mobs aren't into nuances, or subtle differences.
Nerdy invisible heroes walk among us.

Look huge. Sound loud. Make a big deal.

## I had a bar complaint ready

Up to now, I had a private and a public personas. I quietly prepared a bar complaint. That was a saga of its own… until I just sat down to write one.

# Highly visible conflict

## Scandal, or what passes for scandal

Front page news me.
In 2015 I was tried for seven felonies based on seven words I wrote in a late-night, friends-only Facebook post after returning home from a New Year's Eve 
party. How that all happens is a long story, a complicated story, a painful story, and a story I often disbelieve, even after living through it. Also, all 
that was a small part of a larger story. But I won't tell the larger story, and don't have tome to tell you this smaller story.
They brought me into the spotlight, by blaming me for the Wikipedia bias. 

## Perfect storm

In 2016 I decided I would try to reach the people on Facebook who he reaches. He'd post pictures, often of his daughter, that got hundreds of responses from 
his many followers. For a few months, I'd add everyone who Liked his photographs. Eventually we had hundreds of friends in common. I've got a thousand 
Facebook friends now. Most came through that process of slowly adding everyone who took any interest in his Facebook activities.
I doubt he knew any of that when he decided to return me to the press in April, 2018.
In response to his false claims in the press, I was able to use my raised Faccebook profile and the hudnreds of targeted new friends to release the bar 
complaint I had been preparing.

## Combination of parts

What I did before April, I built with my own energy. A tweet that satarized the thinkings of a shallow, powerful man. A place I could quickly write and 
publish to the internet. A special software tool that turned PDF files into pretty internet-ready HTML. These aren't complicated tools. I built them or 
brought them together. In April, thrust into the headlines, strangers began coming to me. My Facebook chat app reached hundreds who had opinions, and 
information. The press made me known, in the day's front-page scandal. I was in the Associated Press, published in 3 metro newspapers nation-wide.
Suddenly I was bona fide. Activists reached out. Activists for prisoners, who hated the prosecutor's tactics. Elected officials who opposed him began 
listening to me.

That's when I first met my biggest ally. She would go on to guide and counsel me for minutes or hours a day through the rest of the year. I have never met her 
face-to-face.

She thinks I could write a screenplay. She described one scene: Off to Tacoma on the train, I lick and stick a suction cup magnet mount on the train window, 
flip my tiny keyboard onto the table, and pound out some publications on the trip. Maybe tweet on the trip.

An officer in the police wrote to me to explain that my tweets were going viral inside two police departments. I was shocked by this. She explained that I was 
producing shocking information. I credit Sean Robinson, the reporter who won a regional First Amendment award for his exposure of the prosecutor's many 
controversies. But the police officer explained that nobody reads articles. People do read tweets. By condensing complicated topics into hand-crafted tweets, 
I was raising awareness of the many stinky facts about a career that probably needed to end. Other officers also made it clear I was making frustrated, 
long-struggling people laugh out loud.

# Going viral

For about 1 year, the resistence was the recall campaign. I met those guys and we worked togheter. But eventually they ran out of signature-gathering steam,
and their leader even got multiple schlerosis. So through 2017, it seemed like I was the main voice of resistence. I remember a hard routine:
How can I find fresh details about my adversary, who loves priming the social media with pics. How can I turn those fresh details into soemthing funny?
And how can I get maybe one or two likes of reinforcement? Or even a re-tweet? For so long I only reached a handful of readers. That improved in plateaus,
after I was in the press, and again after my candidate prevailed in the primary vote. That's when I gained momentum, readership, and fans.

## Aligned challenger

Much changed the day I realized my adversary faced a political challenger who had a strategy very much like my own. On that day I felt weight leaving my shoulders.
I reached out to them. They focused on shifting public percceptions about him, just as i had been doing. When my scandal was on the front page of the print paper,
they were working their campaign about the incident before the day was through. They were great persuasive ccommunicators. I felt such relief that another
big player had entered the ring. I was a one-man operation trying to seem huge. They were a well-oiled political communications system. I sought to remove my adversary,
and they sould to elect their candidate. I rapidly pivoted to a more positive message and conclusion. I also sought to build the reputation of the new candidate.
I will say, too, that I found her to be exceptional. She built key alliances one by one over time, that paid off incredibly. We ran our parallel campaigns toward
the same goal. And with a challenger in place, I ccould shift my strident criticism into the conclusion that change is now possible.

My adversary was sketchy and shady as fuck. His challenger had a lifetime of principled leadership. There was no left-vs-right here, just a lot of right-vs-wrong.
I enjoyed positioning the race's unique dimensions in expose'-type essays on Facebook.

## Shifting roles

At some point in 2018, I didn't have to make stuff up anymore. I didn't have to review court documents and extract key points anymore. Instead, people began 
talking, and I just began quoting them. I became a megaphone repeating things I heard. I shared screencaps with names anonymized. I'd add red lines and hearts 
to other people's words and share the new work. I felt quite different, like I became a conduit, an amplifier for the knoweldge and anger of hundreds.

## A month to go

It felt very strange as election day approached. I attended campaign events, and a debate. Many who never cared before began focusing. I was there to inform 
them of many key facts. It occurred to me that on one day in November, the whole project will be done.

The last month seems like a bore and a blur somehow. I chased down a few attempts by my adversary to disinform, spread rumors virally. I neutralized them,
smashing with clear information and clear critiques. I do not believe this noble path always works. But it was the best idea I had. 

## Offer the clean water

People sometimes approached me
with sleazy schemes to operate in underhanded ways, and I always ignored them. Some tips I got were unethical to share, because other people were involved.
Sometimes I alluded to these claims without repeating them. I repeated a lot of statements made on the internet, but tried to avoid nonsense and extreme hyperbole.

## Impact

I was mostly invisible, an enigma operating in the shadows, having outsized impacts on the public debate. I felt like a puppetmaster, unseen. On my website,
I hosted legal documents without saying who I am. Some were shared broadly. Ultimately I invented a notion of a "Robnett Revolution" and reviewed
all candidates, producing a Voter's Guide. This, too, is more hype, but also informative, and backed quite deeply by information you can explore.I'mH

It's hard to say how much impact I had. Did I change a thousand votes? It's very possible, and if true, it's quite exciting. That's an outsized impact.

Stacy says I was the glue. Using humor and advanced viral tools, I brought many people together. On elecction night, a hip hop artist met me for the
first time at the victory party. He had resisted the prosecutor since 2010. He was among the first to re-tweet my satirical tweets, giving me much-needed reinfocement.

Grafitti artists resisted, too, and I 
amplified their work to a broad audience.

Many attorneys began speaking out, and I channeled many of their first-hand accounts of both attorneys in the race. They shared the link to my twitter and demanded everyone read along.

I also knew the victims, and studied the most severely harmed ones, and felt a kinship with one in particular who was jailed for eight months without evidence of wrongdoing.
The sheriff deputies who he smeared became my amigos at the campaign functions, laughing, filling me in, and telling me how much support I've gained,
and how much hope I was giving, to people who were too afraid to speak out.
I met with lawyers, and earned their trust. Maybe critically, I translated complicated legal battles into words anyone could understand.
I do that professionally for computer software engineers, so it wasn't hard to transition.

# What still seems goofy

## Uncomfortable

I don't like how this is a bunch of words about a bunch of words, some pictures. I embraced it: Now we fight with words, seeking to persuade, in a rich media 
arena. A cyborg just lives there. This isn't a story about Ted Kazinski in his low-informaiton shack making bombs. But what I did write felt like bombs. I'd 
turn a picture into ten or twenty shares. My essays, which often struck an expose' tone and were carefully structured to unfold seductivel on Facebook, got 
hundreds of views. I could structure a continuum of discovery, from a twitter tweet, to a facebook post, to a deep dive on my own website. I could estimate engagement,
and respond to sudden viral popularity. A cyborg just lives there. I just lived in this netherworld of the appearance of life, limbo world of impressions and controversy.
