<title>Mark Lindquist's Performance Review</title>
# Mark Lindquist's performance review

Hello, Mark. What did you **try to sell us** in 2014? 
Let's examine your 
[campaign press release](http://www.exit133.com/newswire/view/prosecutor-lindquist-announces-campaign-kickoff-event/#.WxGSnkgvwcE) from that election:

[http://www.exit133.com/newswire/view/prosecutor-lindquist-announces-campaign-kickoff-event/](http://www.exit133.com/newswire/view/prosecutor-lindquist-announces-campaign-kickoff-event/#.WxGSnkgvwcE)

## Ok, how have these claims panned out?

**Claim:** _"Under Mark's leadership, the Pierce County Prosecutor's Office has earned a state-wide reputation for vigorous prosecution, public service and professionalism," said Troyer._

In fact, he was **leading the state in violations of the rules** for prosecutors, and 
triggering [waves of successful appeals](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/many-pierce-county-cases-reversed-because-of-prosecutors/). 
Vigorous? Reckless. And costly.

<hr>

**Claim:** _"formed a Gang Unit, which has successfully prosecuted hundreds of violent gang members and associates, reducing gang violence in Pierce County by over 50 percent."_  
**Claim:** _"He also began the Elder Fraud Unit that focuses on aggressively prosecuting offenders who victimize our most vulnerable citizens."_

He took credit for this in in 2014. He's still taking credit in this election? Ok, show us
successes. _His office touts the expenditure of $400,000 from the Department of Justice on elder abuse, 
but fails to identify [even one case successfully prosecuted](https://tacomaweekly.com/letter-to-the-editor/letter-to-the-editor-tim-kienberger/)._


<hr>


**Claim:** _"The Prosecutor's Office has a reputation for strong stands against baseless lawsuits, protecting taxpayer money, accessibility and professionalism."_

Laughable. Now he has a reputation for [hiding from legitimate lawsuits](http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/judge-rules-against-prosecutor-in-expensive-public-records-case/686540814), 
and [blowing huge sums of citizen taxes](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/politics-government/article137860268.html) doing it. 
[Lying to judges](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article66983582.html) and [endangering murder trials](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article173451496.html) cannot be called professionalism!


<hr>


**Claim:** _"... a nationally-acclaimed author. His books have been bestsellers and published in several languages."_

3 of his 4 books are [generally considered duds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lindquist#Writing_career).


# Pierce County deserves a straight shooter...
# Lindquist only pitches spin
