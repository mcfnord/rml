# Supreme Court EN BANC Slip Opinion

GORDON MCCLOUD, Jennifer Holmes and James 
Lindsay entered the
home of Laurence Wilkey, Holmes’s former 
boyfriend. They tied him up, beat him,
and took a number of items from his home. The 
State charged Holmes and Lindsay
with first degree robbery, burglary, kidnapping, 
and assault, as well as firearm theft. Holmes and 
Lindsay argued that they did not intend to commit 
a felony but were instead repossessing things that 
Wilkey had originally stolen from Holmes. A jury 
convicted them on most, but not all, counts.

The trial was plagued by misconduct. The 
prosecutor and the lawyer for Holmes (but not 
Lindsay) engaged in unprofessional behavior, 
trading verbal jabs and snide remarks throughout 
over 90 volumes of proceedings in this case. On 
appeal, Holmes and Lindsay argued that the 
prosecutor’s remarks, particularly during closing 
arguments, constituted misconduct that prejudiced 
both defendants. The Court of Appeals agreed that 
Prosecutor Sheeran committed misconduct but split as 
to whether that misconduct caused prejudice. State 
v. Lindsay, 171 Wn. App. 808, 288 P.3d 641 (2012) 
(Lindsay & Holmes). Two judges thought it did not; 
one dissenter thought that it did. Although Holmes 
and Lindsay submitted several issues to this“ 
court in their petitions for review, we accepted 
review of only the prosecutorial misconduct issue. 
State 12. Lindsay, 177 Wn.2d 1023, 303 P.3d 1064 
(2013).

We reverse. To be sure, the jury did its best to 
focus on the facts: it made separate decisions on 
each of the separate crimes charged against each 
defendant and it convicted on some, acquitted on 
some, and convicted of lesser offenses on others. 
In addition, the trial court attempted to maintain 
civility. But <mark>given the magnitude of the problem 
and the two lawyers’ inability to control their 
conduct</mark>, we agree with the Court of Appeals 
dissent that reversal is required. 

# See FACTS

Jennifer Holmes met James Lindsay and decided to 
marry him. This ended her relationship with 
Laurence Wilkey, with whom she had been living in 
Idaho. Wilkey moved out while Holmes and Lindsay 
were away on a trip together, and he took several 
things of value with him. When Holmes returned to 
an empty house, she called the police. After 
investigating, the police in Idaho advised her 
that it was a civil matter and that she should get 
a civil attorney.

Holmes did not follow this advice. Instead, she 
and Lindsay tracked Wilkey down to his new home in 
Pierce County. The precise details of their 
encounter are disputed, and Lindsay, Holmes, and 
Wilkey all gave significantly different accounts 
of what happened. Taking the facts in the light 
most favorable to the State, though, Lindsay and 
Holmes entered the house; Lindsay and Wilkey 
scuffled; Wilkey got the worst of it and ended up 
tied up on the floor. He may have been threatened 
with a gun and beaten with a pipe after he was 
tied up. Lindsay and Holmes then took a number of 
things that they claimed belonged to Holmes and 
left.

The State charged Lindsay and Holmes with one 
count each of first degree burglary, first degree 
robbery, first degree kidnapping, and first degree 
assault, and four counts each of theft of a 
firearm. At a joint trial, the jury convicted 
Lindsay of first degree burglary, first degree 
robbery, one of the four counts of firearm theft, 
and the lesser included crimes of second degree 
kidnapping and second degree assault. Clerk’s 
Papers (CP) (Lindsay) at 382—89. It also convicted 
Holmes of first degree burglary, first degree 
robbery, one of the four counts of firearm theft, 
and the lesser included crimes of unlawful 
imprisonment and second degree assault. CP 
(Holmes) at 708-27.

<mark>The record shows that the prosecutor, John 
Sheeran, and Holmes’s defense counsel, Barbara 
Corey, engaged in unprofessional exchanges 
throughout the trial.</mark> The dissent in the Court of 
Appeals accurately describes some of those 
exchanges:

<ul>For example, not only did Prosecutor Sheeran and 
Holmes’s counsel interrupt each other, they 
interrupted the trial court, at one point causing 
the trial court to ask, “Can I finish for once?” 
42 [Report of Proceedings (RP)] RP at 3569. Other 
examples of disrespect to the trial court include 
Prosecutor Sheeran telling the trial court that 
Holmes’s counsel’s request to interrupt the trial 
was “a joke” and “ridiculous” and that Holmes’s 
counsel wanted a “Burger King trial . . . [h]ave 
it my way.” 34 RP at 2557. At another point, the 
prosecutor told the trial court, <mark>“I didn’t object 
[earlier] because I was laughing so hard it was so 
stupid.”</mark> 53 RP at 457 2-73. Later, Prosecutor Sheeran 
told Holmes’s counsel that she was repeating 
herself[;] she replied by telling him to “kindly 
shut up.” 51 RP at 4309. Prosecutor Sheeran then asked 
the trial court to instruct Holmes’s counsel not 
to repeat herself; Holmes’s counsel replied, 
“Maybe [the prosecutor] could borrow Your Honor’s 
gown and tell us
all how to run this trial.” 51 RP at 4309.

In another instance, Holmes’s counsel told the 
trial court that Prosecutor Sheeran’s comments were 
“obnoxious.” 44 RP at 3831. In response, the 
prosecutor said, “This is the same garbage that I 
was talking about
days ago when I lost my temper in this courtroom, because it’s what
she does.”</ul>

<hr>

<sup>1</sup> Note that the following exchanges
took place outside the presence of the jury;
we cite it only as context for the general tenor of the trial.
All other statements present in this opinion
are statements that were said in front of the jury,
unless otherwise noted.

# See The record is filled with similar acrimony

The record is filled with similar acrimony. The 
primary source of the misconduct, 
however—according to the parties and the Court of 
Appeals———was Prosecutor Sheeran’s closing argument.

In his closing, <mark>Prosecutor Sheeran called the 
defense’s closing argument “a crock.”
The prosecutor also stated that the defendant 
Holmes’s testimony was “funny,” “disgusting, 
comical,” and “the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever 
heard.” Id. at 8717, 8722, 8708. He told the jury 
that Holmes should not “get up here and
sit here and lie.” Id. at 8882.</mark>

Prosecutor Sheeran described the beyond a reasonable 
doubt standard as follows:

“[Y]ou put in about 10 more pieces and see this 
picture . . . . [Y]ou can be halfway done with 
that puzzle. . . . You could have 50 percent of 
those puzzle pieces missing and you know it’s 
Seattle. Id. at 8727. He also compared it to the 
amount of certainty one needs to cross the street 
in a crosswalk. Id. at 8728 (“You’re walking 
because beyond a reasonable doubt you’re confident 
you can walk across that crosswalk without getting 
run over.”). Further, Prosecutor Sheeran exhorted the 
jury to “[s]peak the truth.” Id. at 8730. He asked 
the jury “only to do what you swore to do: Render 
verdicts.” Id. He explained that “verdict” is 
Latin for “to speak the truth” and that “voir 
dire” means the same in French. Id. Finally, he 
stated, “You start with one, voir dire, when you 
started this trial, and you end with one, 
verdictum, verdict. So I’m just asking you to do 
what you know is true: Speak the truth. Convict 
both of these defendants . . . .” 1a.

Finally, <mark>Prosecutor Sheeran spoke so quietly to 
the jury on several occasions that the court 
reporter could not hear him and the judge had to 
ask him to repeat himself.</mark> Prosecutor Sheeran 
then made a joke out of this when Holmes’s counsel 
protested by standing behind her and speaking very 
loudly, to the laughter of the jury.

<center>ANALYSIS</center>

“Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct are 
reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.” 
State 12. Brett, 126 Wn.2d 136, 174—75, 892 P.2d 
29 (1995) (citing State v. Hughes, 106 Wn.2d 176, 
195, 721 P.2d 902 (1986)). The defendant bears the 
burden of showing that the comments were improper 
and prejudicial. State v. Warren, 165 Wn.2d 17, 
26, 195 P.3d 940 (2008). In the past, our court 
has also stated that if the defendant fails to 
object or request a curative instruction at trial, 
the issue of misconduct is waived unless the 
conduct was so flagrant and ill intentioned that 
an instruction could not have cured the resulting 
case, however, defense counsel made a motion for a 
mistrial due to prosecutorial misconduct directly 
following Prosecutor Sheeran’s rebuttal closing 
argument, citing many of the same examples that 
are raised on appeal. Thus, the issue was 
preserved for appellate review.

The prosecutorial misconduct inquiry therefore 
consists of two prongs: (1) whether the 
prosecutor’s comments were improper; and (2) if 
so, whether the improper comments caused 
prejudice. Warren, 165 Wn.2d at 26. We thus begin 
by analyzing the propriety of Prosecutor Sheeran’s 
comments.

# See IMPROPER COMMENTS

<mark>Prosecutor Sheeran made improper statements in 
this case.</mark> Both the Court of Appeals 
majority and dissent concluded that many of his 
comments were improper. Even the State, in its 
supplemental briefing to this court, admits that 
some of the comments were improper. The State’s 
argument is, essentially, that many of the 
improper comments either were not objected to, or 
were made in response to goading by Holmes’s 
counsel; and, since those comments were not so 
flagrant and ill intentioned that an instruction 
would not have cured any prejudicial effect, those 
errors are waived. As. for the remaining, 
specifically objected—to, comments where the 
objection was made in the middle of closing, the 
State argues that even if improper, they did not 
affect the outcome of the trial. 

a. Impugning

A prosecutor can certainly argue that the evidence 
does not support the defense theory. State 12. 
Russell, 125 Wn.2d 24, 87, 882 P.2d 747 (1994) 
(citing State v. Graham, 59 Wn. App. 418, 429, 79 
P.2d 314 (1990)). <mark>However, a prosecutor must not 
impugn the role or integrity of defense counsel.</mark> 
Warren, 165 Wn.2d at 29— 30; State v. Negrete, 72 
Wn. App. 62, 67, 863 P.2d 137 (1993). 
Prosecutorial statements that malign defense 
counsel can severely damage an accused’s 
opportunity to present his or her case and are 
therefore impermissible. 

<mark>The Court of Appeals found that Prosecutor Sheeran 
impugned defense counsel with the following 
comments: “‘[S]he doesn’t care if the objection is 
sustained or
not,” “‘We’re going to have like a sixth grader 
[argument],’” and “‘[W]e’re into silly. Lindsay & 
Holmes, 171 Wn. App. at 827 (alterations in 
original). In addition, the Court of Appeals 
relied on the following interactions:

<ul>Another time, Holmes’s counsel was in the middle of an objection and
Prosecutor Sheeran interrupted her saying, “Yeah, we all know that.” 87
VRP at 8092. Yet another time, Prosecutor Sheeran responded to Holmes’s
counsel’s objection by stating, “Maybe if counsel and her client could
just be quiet for a few minutes they might be able to hear something.”
95 VRP at 8887. At one point, Prosecutor Sheeran became visibly upset and
Holmes’s counsel said Prosecutor Sheeran is having “a tantrum.” 52 VRP
at 4554. Prosecutor Sheeran replied, “And counsel walked right into this
after freaking six weeks” and said directly to Holmes’s counsel,
“Tantrum, because you-————.” 52 VRP at 4554.</ul>

Id. at 827.

<mark>This exchange (and the many more like it) is 
self-centered and rude.</mark> It is all about the 
lawyers’ personalities, not the parties’ cases. It 
is clearly the fault of both lawyers, and it is so 
obnoxious and so continuous that it permeates the 
record. In fact, it seems to this court that it 
would be incredibly difficult to focus on the 
issue of guilt or innocence with this grating 
noise in the background. Such incivility threatens 
the fairness of the trial, not to mention public 
respect for the courts. See Jones v. City 
ofSeattZe, 179 Wn.2d 322, 371, 314 P.3d 380 (2013) 
(Gonzalez, J., concurring).

These comments quoted immediately above, alone, 
though, probably do not require reversal. In past 
cases finding that Prosecutor Sheeran impugned defense 
counsel, Prosecutor Sheeran made more egregious 
statements than the ones above. In Negrere, for 
example, the prosecutor said that defense counsel 
was “‘being paid to twist the words of the 
witnesses.”’ impermissibly contrasted the roles of 
prosecutor and defense counsel, stating that while 
the defense attorney’s duty was to his criminal 
client, the prosecutor’s duty was “‘to see that 
justice is served.” 111 Wn. App. 276, 283, 45 P.3d 
205 (2002). And in Bruno, “the obvious import of 
the prosecutor’s comments was that all defense 
counsel in criminal cases are retained solely to 
lie and distort the facts and camouflage the 
truth.” 721 F.2d at 1194. Thus, the unprofessional 
exchanges above, alone, probably did not 
fundamentally undermine defense counsel’s role or 
integrity. They certainly undermined the authority 
of the court and the formality of the proceeding, 
though.

Another statement by Prosecutor Sheeran, however, did 
directly impugn defense counsel. The prosecutor 
stated in closing, in reference to Holmes’s 
counsel’s closing argument, “This is a crock. What 
you’ve been pitched for the last four hours is a 
crock.” 95 VRP at 8877. In State v. Morgersorz, we 
held that “the prosecutor impugned defense 
counsel’s integrity, particularly in referring to 
his presentation of his case as ‘bogus’ and 
involving “sleight of hand.” 172 Wn.2d 438, 
451-52, 258 P.3d 43 (2011) (citing Warren, 165 
Wn.2d at 29). We continued, “In particular, 
‘sleight of hand’ implies wrongful deception or 
even dishonesty in the context of a court 
proceeding.” Id. at 452 (defining “sleight of 
hand”) “(quoting WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 2141 (2003)).

<mark>The term “crock” is at least as bad. It also 
implies deception and dishonesty.
In addition, the term “a crock” is commonly 
understood to be a shortening of an
explicitly vulgar phrase. Describing a defense 
counsel’s argument with that full
phrase would certainly impugn defense counsel’s 
integrity. Calling counsel’s
argument “a crock” is not much different. Given 
our discussion of the terms “bogus”
and “sleight of hand” in Torgerson, we hold that 
Prosecutor Sheeran impugned defense
counsel in this case by calling Holmes’s counsel’s 
closing arguments “a crock.”</mark>

b. Burden of Proof

Arguments by the prosecution that shift or 
misstate the State’s burden to prove
the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt 
constitute misconduct. State v.
Gregory, 158 Wn.2d 759, 859-60, 147 P.3d 1201 
(2006). The Court of Appeals
found that Prosecutor Sheeran misstated the burden of 
proof by comparing the beyond a
reasonable doubt standard to figuring out a jigsaw 
puzzle and crossing the street, and by telling the 
jury to speak the truth. 

i. Jigsaw Puzzles

Regarding puzzles, Prosecutor Sheeran stated:

<ul>[O]ne of the simplest [ways to explain reasonable 
doubt] is the idea of a jigsaw puzzle. . . . [T]he 
first thing you do is you get all the pieces that 
have edges on them, start to lock them together, 
you're trying to get the outline. . . . [Y]ou put 
a few more pieces in . . . and you start to get a 
better idea of what that picture is. . . . And 
then you put in about 10 more pieces and see this 
picture of the Space Needle. Now, you can be 
halfway done with that puzzle and you know beyond 
a reasonable doubt that it’s Seattle. You could 
have 50 percent of those puzzle pieces missing and 
you know it’s Seattle.</ul>

95 VRP at 8726—27.

Several cases from the Court of Appeals have 
examined whether puzzle analogies are improper.

In State v. Johnson, a Division Two case, the 
prosecutor made an argument nearly identical to 
the one above, stating, “‘You add a third piece of 
the puzzle, and at this point even being able to 
see only half, you can be assured beyond a 
reasonable doubt that this is going to be a 
picture of Tacoma.” 158 Wn. App. 677, 682, 243 
P.3d 936 (2010). The court held that “the 
prosecutor’s arguments discussing the reasonable 
doubt standard in the context of making an 
affirmative decision based on a partially 
completed puzzle trivialized the State’s burden, 
focused on the degree of certainty the jurors 
needed to act, and implied that the jury had a 
duty to convict without a reason not to do so.” 
1d. at 685. The court reversed the conviction, 
stating that “a misstatement about the law and the 
presumption of innocence due a defendant, the 
‘bedrock upon which [our] criminal justice system 
stands,’ constitutes
great prejudice because it reduces the State’s 
burden and undermines a defendant’s
due process rights.” Id. at 685—86 (quoting State 
12. Bennett, 161 Wn.2d 303, 315, 165 P.3d 1241 
(2007)).

In State v. Curtiss, Division Two reached a 
different conclusion regarding a similar jigsaw 
puzzle argument. 161 Wn. App. 673, 250 P.3d 496 
(2011). There, the prosecutor stated, “‘There will 
come a time when you’re putting that puzzle 
together, and even with pieces missing, you’ll be 
able to say, with some certainty, beyond a 
reasonable doubt what that puzzle is: The Tacoma 
Dome.” Id. at 700. The court did not mention 
Johnson but held that the State’s comments about 
identifying a puzzle before it was complete were 
not improper. Id. at 700—01.

In State v. Fuller, Division Two explained the 
difference between Johnson
and Curtiss. 169 Wn. App. 797, 282 P.3d 126 
(2012), review denied, 176 Wn.2d 1006, 297 P.3d 68 
(2013). The Fuller court explained that the 
quantification by the prosecutor of the number of 
pieces and percentage of completion required for 
reasonable doubt in Johnson was entirely different 
from the prosecutor’s general reference to being 
able to discern the subject of a puzzle with some 
pieces missing in Curtiss. Id. at 825—28. The 
former statement introduced elements of specific 
quantification into the reasonable doubt analysis, 
while the latter did not. Id.

This case is plainly analogous to Johnson, not 
Curtiss. The prosecutor stated that “you put in 
about 10 more pieces and see this picture of the 
Space Needle. Now,
you can be halfway done with that puzzle and you 
know beyond a reasonable doubt
that it’s Seattle. You could have 50 percent of 
those puzzle pieces missing and you know it’s 
Seattle.” 95 VRP at 8727. That is almost identical 
to the comments held prejudicial misconduct in 
Johnson. It is not analogous to the comments in 
Curtiss or Fuller, which made no reference to any 
number or percentage and merely suggested that one 
could be certain of the picture beyond a 
reasonable doubt even with some pieces missing. We 
agree that the quantifying of the standard of 
proof by means of this jigsaw puzzle analogy is 
improper. 

ii. Crosswalks

In explaining reasonable doubt in his closing, the 
prosecutor told a narrative about approaching a 
crosswalk and seeing a car coming:

<ul>He has the red light, you’ve got a walk sign, you 
look at him, he sees
you, he’s slowing down, he nods and you start 
walking. You’re walking
because beyond a reasonable doubt you’re confident 
you can walk
across that crosswalk without getting run over.</ul>

Id. at 8728. As the Court of Appeals points out, 
<mark>“When a prosecutor compares the reasonable doubt 
standard to everyday decision making, it 
improperly minimizes and trivializes the gravity 
of the standard and the jury’s role.”</mark> Lindsay & 
Holmes, 171 Wn. App. at 828 (citing State v. 
Anderson, 153 Wn. App. 417, 431, 220 P.3d 1273 
(2009)). We agree with the Court of Appeals that 
this kind of analogy to
everyday experiences trivializes the State’s 
burden of proof and is improper.

iii. Speaking the Truth

The Court of Appeals held that telling the jury to 
“find the truth” or “speak the trut ” is improper. 
That court had previously held such statements 
trivialized the burden of proof in Anderson: “The 
prosecutor’s repeated requests that the jury 
‘declare the truth,’ however, were improper. A 
jury’s job is not to ‘solve’ a case. . . . Rather, 
the jury’s duty is to determine whether the State 
has proved its allegations against a defendant 
beyond a reasonable doubt.” 153 Wn. App. at 429.

There is some conflict in Division Two cases about 
whether‘an exhortation to the jury to “speak the 
truth” is improper. In Anderson, the court held 
that it was improper. In Cnrtz'ss, the court held 
that it was not. Later, in State v. Walker, 
Division Two implicitly rejected Curtlss on this 
point. 164 Wn. App. 724, 733, 265 P.3d 191 (201 1) 
(“We rely on Anderson [as opposed to Cnrtz'ss] in 
our determination the statements in the present 
case are improper conduct”).

The Court of Appeals agreed that the statements in 
this case were misconduct under Walker. The 
statements in Walker are nearly identical to the 
statements at issue here. Walker, 164 Wn. App. at 
732—33 (“‘The word “verdict” comes from a Latin 
word, “veredictum.” Veredictum means to declare 
the truth. And so by your verdict in this case, 
you folks, the 12 of you who will deliberate, will 
decide the truth
of what happened . . . .’”).

<mark>We agree. Telling the jury that its job is to 
“speak the truth,” or some variation
thereof, misstates the burden of proof and is 
improper.</mark>

c. Expression of Personal Opinion of Credibility/Guilt 

It is impermissible for a prosecutor to 
express a personal opinion as to the credibility 
of a witness or the guilt of a defendant. State v. 
Reed, 102 Wn.2d 140, 145, 684 P.2d 699 (1984) 
(citing AM. BAR ASS’N, MODEL CODE OF PROFESSIONAL
RESPONSIBILITY AND CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT § DR 
7—106(C)(4) (1980)). It constitutes misconduct, 
id., and violates the advocate—witness rule, which 
“prohibits an attorney from appearing as both a 
witness and an advocate in the same litigation.” 
Prantil, 764 F.2d at 552-53.

<mark>Prosecutor Sheeran told the jury in his closing that 
the defendant Holmes’s testimony was “funny” and 
“disgusting,” 95 VRP at 8717, “comical,” id. at 
8722, and “the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever 
heard,”</mark> id. at 8708. The Court of Appeals noted 
that words like “ridiculous” or “preposterous” in 
relation to testimony are not, alone, an improper 
expression of personal opinion as long as the 
prosecutor is arguably drawing an inference from 
the evidence. Anderson, 153 Wn. App. at 430. The 
Court of Appeals also noted, though, that the 
prosecutor told the jury that Holmes should not 
“get up here and sit here and lie.” 95 VRP at 
8882. And the Court of Appeals was particularly 
disturbed by the prosecutor’s reference to 
Holmes’s theory of the case as “a crock,” which it 
held was plainly an expression of
personal opinion as to credibility. Lindsay & 
Holmes, l7l Wn. App. at 833.

Prosecutor Sheeran’s “crock” comment was a comment on 
both defense counsel’s closing argument and the 
defendant Holmes’s testimony, because the two are 
to some degree inseparable. The prosecutor’s 
argument that Holmes lied on the stand and the 
statement that Holmes’s testimony was “the most 
ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard” are even more 
direct statements of the prosecutor’s personal 
opinion as to Holmes’s veracity. 95 VRP at 8722. 
An isolated use of the term “ridiculous” to 
describe a witness’s testimony is not improper in 
every circumstance. But labeling testimony “the 
most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard” is an 
obvious expression of personal opinion as to 
credibility. There is no other reasonable 
interpretation of the phrase. Given that comment, 
in context with the “crock” accusation and the 
“sit here and lie” argument, we hold that <mark>the 
prosecutor in this case impermissibly expressed 
his personal opinion about the defendant’s 
credibility to the jury.</mark>

d. Inaudible statements to jury

Prosecutor Sheeran during closing arguments spoke to 
the jury so softly that the court reporter, 
parties, and their attorneys could not hear him. 
The prosecutor’s voice became inaudible three 
times. The first time, the record states, “Do they 
get . . . (sotto voce.)” 95 VRP at 8884 
(alteration in original). After the court reporter 
and defendants” lawyers said they could not hear 
the prosecutor, the judge stated, “Keep your voice 
up, please, so everybody can hear.” Id. at 8885. 
The second time,
the record states, “I mean, the Jennifer Holmes 
story is arguably —- well, it’s silly . .
. (sotto voce.)” Id. at 8886 (alteration in 
original). Defense counsel complained, and the 
judge asked the reporter to “read that back.” Id. 
The reporter said, “I did not hear it, Judge,” and 
the judge replied, “Okay.” Id. Another debate 
between counsel ensued, and the prosecutor 
eventually continued his closing without a further 
remark from the judge. The third time, the record 
states, “Ask yourself who wants to fmd the truth 
and . . . (sotto voce.)” Id. at 8888. The reporter 
responded, “Ask yourself . . ?” Id. (alteration in 
original). The prosecutor answered, “Who wants to 
find the truth. Ask yourself what the truth is. 
Convict them.” Id. No other comment was made on 
this third incident. <mark>During one of these 
incidents, Prosecutor Sheeran, after being told no one 
could hear him, stood directly behind Holmes’s 
counsel and shouted his next sentence very loudly, 
to the laughter of the jury.</mark> Finally, in a later 
motion for \ mistrial based in part on the 
prosecutor’s whispering, the judge stated in 
denying the motion, “1 did tell [Prosecutor Sheeran] 
to speak up and he did speak up, and I thought he 
repeated everything that he said in a voice that 
everybody could hear, and I think
that’s what he said on the record.” 97 VRP at 
8993.

The Court of Appeals did not expressly label this 
misconduct. It held that although “a prosecutor 
must never whisper to the jury off the record,” 
the record in
this case was “sufficiently complete” to permit 
review. Lindsay & Holmes, l7l Wn.

The dissent disagreed. It asserted <mark>this whispering 
amounted to a private communication with the jury, 
which is presumed prejudicial,</mark> thus shifting the 
burden to the State to prove the communication was 
harmless. Id. at 851—52 (Armstrong, J. Pro Tem., 
dissenting) (citing Remmer v. United States, 347 
US. 227, 229, 74 S. Ct. 450, 98 L. Ed. 654 (1954); 
State v. Keil, 101 Wn. App. 619, 621, 5 P.3d 47 
(2000); State 12. Murphy, 44 Wn. App. 290, 296, 
721 P.2d 30 (1986)). Without knowing what the 
prosecutor said to the jury, the dissent argued, 
prejudice must be presumed and the State has not 
rebutted that presumption.

In this case, however, the judge stated, in 
denying a defense motion for mistrial based on the 
whispering, “I did tell [the prosecutor] to speak 
up and he did speak up, and I thought he repeated 
everything that he said in a voice that everybody 
could hear, and I think that’s what he said on the 
record.” 97 VRP at 8993. Under the circumstances, 
we find the prosecutor’s whispering, although 
improper, was not presumptively prejudicial. We 
emphasize, however, that <mark>the prosecutor’s behavior 
in both whispering and shouting, as revealed 
through transcripts and affidavits, was highly 
unprofessional and potentially damaging to the 
fairness of the proceedings.</mark>

11. PREJUDICE

a. The Standard for Determining Prejudice 

A claim 
of prosecutorial misconduct requires the defendant 
to show both that
the prosecutor made improper statements and that 
those statements caused prejudice.
To show prejudice, the petitioners must show a 
substantial likelihood that the prosecutor’s 
statements affected the jury’s verdict. State v. 
Emery, 174 Wn.2d 741, 760, 278 P.3d 653 (2012) 
(citing Anderson, 153 Wn. App. at 427).

The State argues that if the petitioners failed to 
object to a particular statement by the 
prosecutor, they must also show that a jury 
instruction would not have cured the potential 
prejudice. 1d. at 761.‘4 The State points out that 
the following statements did not draw immediate 
objections: calling Holmes’s testimony “funny,”
disgusting,’ and “comical”; the use of the jigsaw 
puzzle analogy and crosswalk analogy to explain 
reasonable doubt and the exhortation to the jury 
to “speak the truth”; and the “crock” and “sit 
here and lie” comments However, directly after the 
prosecutor’s closing argument, Holmes’s counsel 
made a motion for mistrial. In that motion she 
identified a number of the prosecutor’s statements 
as improper for the reasons noted above, stating 
specifically that “he made his personal opinions 
about
the evidence [known] on numerous occasions,” 95 
VRP at 8890, and that “he is
disparaging counsel, just, you know, egregiously,” 
id. at 8891. The Ninth Circuit
has recognized that a defense counsel entering 
“objections to the language and tenor
of the prosecutor’s closing remarks by way of a 
mistrial motion after the government finished its 
summation” is “an acceptable mechanism by which to 
preserve challenges to prosecutorial conduct in a 
closing argument in lieu of repeated interruptions 
to the closing arguments,” and therefore that the 
ordinary standard for examining prejudice applies. 
Prantil, 764 F.2d at 555 n.4 (citing United States 
v. Lyman, 592 F.2d 496, 499 (9th Cir. 1979)). The 
rule in Prantil advances the policy reasons for 
the contemporaneous objection rule, such as giving 
the trial court a chance to correct the problem 
with a curative instruction, and we therefore 
adopt it. Under this rule, the defense certainly 
preserved the issue for review. b. Application of 
the Standard The State argues that Holmes’ s 
counsel baited the prosecutor into misconduct,
and so his improper statements cannot be grounds 
for reversal. It is true that
improper comments by the prosecutor might not be 
grounds for reversal if they were specifically 
provoked by defense counsel. State 12. Weber, 159 
Wn.2d 252, 276—77, 149 P.3d 646 (2006).

That is not what happened in this case, though. 
Most of the improper arguments in this case 
occurred during Prosecutor Sheeran’s closing. They are 
not directly preceded by any statements from 
defense counsel to which the prosecutor was 
responding. Moreover, in this context, the 
prosecutor is held to a higher
standard than defense counsel. E. g, State 12. 
Monday, 171 Wn.2d 667, 676, 257 P.3d 21
551 (2011) <mark>(“The prosecutor owes a duty to 
defendants to see that their rights to a 
constitutionally fair trial are not violated.”</marK> 
(citing State v. Case, 49 Wn.2d 66, 71, 298 P.2d 
500 (195 6))). We reject the State’s argument that 
Prosecutor Sheeran’s behavior in this case is excused 
because Holmes’s counsel also acted 
unprofessionally.

The State also argues that defense counsel failed 
to object to many of the statements in the 
prosecutor’s closing argument, so the defendants 
have waived any claim of prejudice relating to 
those statements. But, as explained above, 
Holmes’s defense counsel made a motion for 
mistrial directly following Prosecutor Sheeran’s 
closing argument objecting to “the language and 
tenor of the prosecutor’s closing remarks.” 
Praniii, 764 F.2d at 555 n.4. Thus, her motion was 
sufficient to preserve review under the ordinary 
prejudice standard.

The State’s argument also disregards the context 
of the trial. The many examples of misconduct in 
this case “demonstrate more than the prosecutor’s 
and Holmes’s counsel’s treatment of each other; 
<mark>they show an unthinkable disrespect for the trial 
court and the whole trial process.”</mark> Lindsay & 
Holmes, 171 Wn. App. at 851 (Armstrong, J. Pro 
Tem., dissenting). Such disrespect for the process 
infects the entire trial. See Jones, 179 Wn.2d at 
371 (Gonzalez, J ., concurring). Under the 
circumstances, <mark>there is a substantial likelihood 
that Prosecutor Sheeran’s calling the
defense’s closing arguments “a crock,” telling the 
jury that defendant Holmes should
not “lie, and labeling her testimony “the most 
ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard” influenced the 
jury’s verdict.</mark> Even under the more stringent 
standard for determining prejudice, the results
would be the same. In In re Personal Restraint of Giasmann, despite the defendant’s
failure to object, “the misconduct . . . was so pervasive that it could not have been
cured by an instruction.” 175 Wn.2d 696, 707, 286 P.3d 673 (2012). Here, as in
Giasmann, “‘[T]he cumulative effect of repetitive prejudicial prosecutorial
misconduct may be so flagrant that no instruction or series of instructions can erase
their combined prejudicial effect.” Id. (alteration in original) (quoting State v.
Walker, 164 Wn. App. 724, 737, 265 P.3d 191 (2011)). Moreover, federal courts
have held that comments at the end of a prosecutor’s rebuttal closing are more likely
to cause prejudice. E.g., United States v. Sanchez, 659 F.3d 1252, 1259 (9th Cir.
201 1) (significant that prosecutor made improper statement “at the end of his closing
rebuttal argument, after which the jury commenced its deliberations”); United States
12. Carter, 236 F.3d 777, 788 (6th Cir. 2001) (significant that “prosecutor’s improper
comments occurred during his rebuttal argument and therefore were the last words
from an attorney that were heard by the jury before deliberations”). Here, the
prosecutor made several of his improper comments, including the “crock” and “sit
here and lie” statements, during his rebuttal closing, increasing their prejudicial
effect.

We recognize that the jury in this case took care 
to parse the competing narratives presented by the 
parties and to render considered verdicts on each 
of the many counts. It convicted on only some of 
the charges and returned several lesser included 
offense convictions. We also recognize that the 
judge attempted to curb the two lawyers’ 
incivility, even, at one point, threatening 
sanctions. We nevertheless find <mark>the fairness of 
the trial, which turned largely on credibility, 
was tainted by (l) the pervasive misconduct of the 
prosecutor and (2) the unprofessionalism displayed 
by both Prosecutor Sheeran and Holmes’s attorney 
throughout the proceedings. We reverse the Court 
of Appeals because of both problems, reverse the 
defendants’ convictions, and remand this case for 
a new trial.</mark>

CONCLUSION

<mark>Prosecutor Sheeran and defense counsel for one 
of the defendants in this case behaved 
unprofessionally and disrespectfully towards each 
other, towards the defendants, and towards the 
court throughout the trial. That disrespect 
permeated the trial process. Against that 
background, Prosecutor Sheeran, in his closing 
arguments, denigrated defense counsel, misstated 
the burden of proof, expressed his personal belief 
as to one defendant’s veracity, and whispered to 
the jury so that no one else in the courtroom 
could hear him. There is a substantial likelihood 
that those actions, in context, affected the 
jury’s verdict.</mark> Given the defendant’s immediate 
postargument motion for mistrial, there is no need 
to decide whether a curative instruction could 
have cured the prejudice. But even under that more 
stringent standard, the defendants have 
demonstrated a likelihood of prejudice in this 
case.

<mark>We reverse the Court of Appeals and remand 
the case for a new trial.</mark>
