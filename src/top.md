# Busto Report

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: In response to two detailed 
whistleblower complaints, Pierce County hired an 
outside investigator, through Sebris, Busto, and James. The 
investigator interviewed 65 witnesses and examined 22 
source documents for the 65-page report. Findings 
include:

 * Lindquist retaliates against employees who criticize him. 
 * Lindquist urged "no good deals" for a group of defense attorneys who were critical of him.
 * Lindquist inquired several times about the attractiveness of a job applicant.
 * Lindquist said, according to several witnesses, that the 2009 Lakewood shooting of four police officers was worth **"$100,000 of free publicity"** for his pending re-election campaign.

# Nissen II judgement

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: In April, 2018, a judge ruled Lindquist violated the Public Records act, and levied a major 
fine on taxpayers. The judge also forced disclosure of key messages that are likely evidence in a larger lawsuit 
against Lindquist. With this judgement, the total costs for his handling of this claim now exceeds $1,000,000 
(one million dollars). **Because he is elected, taxpayers are responsible for this cost.** An employment 
discrimination suit that was delayed by evidence at issue in the Nissen II lawsuit now proceeds in federal court. 
With this additional evidence against Lindquist, future costs could be dramatic.

# _Washington v. Nemetz_ disciplinary hearing
