# Long weekend in jail

Any weekend in jail is a long one. I met some good people there. I felt uncomfortable walking around, and 
mostly stayed in my bunk. The mattress I had was terrible, and my back hurt a lot. Eventually I swapped it 
for a better one that wasn't in use.

On arraignment day, many prisoners were called to a side room to talk with legal assistants. I was the 
only one who explained I had private counsel.

# Arraignment

Arraignment is an exciting time for accused prisoners. A lot of people learn there that no charges will be 
filed against them--they're going home soon.

Arraignment is also a change of company. I had been kept in the non-violent area. At arraignment, I made 
the acquaintence of some scary dudes. I also remember a uniquely brilliant man, a mathmetician with an 
advanced degree and opioid addiction. He was highly respected among prisoners because he knew the 
sentencing guidelines. A prisoner could tell him his criminal history, and he could estimate what the 
arraignment judge would do. How much your bail will be is the only question anyone has for the arraignment 
judge, and this guy's obvious skill at estimating was very valued. But he couldn't figure my case until 
clues emerged.

As each person was called from the arraignment holding cell before the judge, we'd wish them success. On 
their return, we'd ask how it went. They may have just learned they risk years in a prison, or would 
be 
going home soon, so the excitement was palpable, and most were enthusiastic to share. Two phrases common 
to jail were repeated in that pen: *some bullshit* and *it is what it is*.

I'll pause here to point out something you might not realize about jail. In my day, especially in Seattle, 
face-to-face interaction must compete with mobile phones showing social media and the rest of the vast 
internet. In jail, people interact, and are largely returned to a human's normal state of curiousity about 
others, and an eagerness to interact, even with strangers. I joked with the math whiz that people pay good 
money for a Buddhist retreat where there are no mobile devices and cable TVs.

I remember a man whose common-law wife had turned him in days after she says he harmed her. She was in the 
gallery at the arraignment yelling how much she missed him, and how she wanted him back. He explained that 
he did 19 years for a murder he didn't commit, and had given enough of his life to the state. He was a 
physically intimidating figure. He talked about how much his wife drinks, and how she gets out of control 
and becomes another person. Three prisoners gathered close to him while the math whiz explained that his 
wife is an alcoholic, and can't control her drinking like many can. He said he wanted to get out of this 
country, and go to Hawaii. Nobody was going to quibble. We said that was a good plan.

As men returned from seeing the judge, details emerged. Someone noticed a television camera. Through lore 
and logic they knew there must be someone accused of a notorious crime. The math whiz also explained that 
a judge in front of a camera is dangerous, because they must appear tough for the television audience. 
Eventually, Math Whiz and I noticed everyone else but me had faced the judge. He eventually concluded, 
"They must be here for you. You're the Sacrificial Lamb!" I guess this was the hardest moment of my 
interaction with Pierce County's criminal justice system. Math Whiz, who was also a Seventh Day Adventist, 
quoted some theology that brought me some comfort.

I didn't dare wave or smile. In hindsight I wish I did. Anyone who knows me knows I'm not inclined to 
threats or violence, and would much rather make a friend. Tim Leary came to mind, always smiling becaue he 
knew the medium is the message. But the judge was already motivated by the television cameras to show 
dominance over the lawless danger she was told I represented. So I stuck with a stoic face.

To this day, I compare my bail, $75,000, or "seventy five racks" to that of other accused. Back in 
lock-up, this sum made me revered. I must be some criminal to merit that much bail, especially with no 
priors. One charismatic man invited me to share with his group what my crime was. "They claim I threatened 
to murder a judge!" Listeners loved this. "But I didn't do it!" Of course, they said. None of us did.

# See Leaving jail

At the exit to the jail, an officer behind some plexiglass returned my personal property. I tried to open 
the door to leave, but there wasn't a handle. "That's kind of the point," she said. She hit the buzzer and 
I was free.

# TV news

That night my family drove me to SeaTac, where I lived. I saw the television broadcast on the internet 
before I left the car. Of course the music video made visual and scary news, when added to the false 
police reports. But I bet Mark Lindquist's extrajudicial comments were icing on the cake for KIRO editors. 
*Considered me a threat. Didn't wait. Rounded me up.* What an illusion of efficacy he provided, a series 
of false statements, made publically at the expense of my reputation, and obviously endangering my right 
to a fair trial. Yeah, Champ. He said what he thought would keep his job safe. Truth was secondary, and he 
thought it was OK to risk everything else as collateral damage.

I walked into my job in downtown Seattle on Tuesday. Nobody noticed I had missed Monday, and nobody even 
saw the news broadcast. For a time, I occupied both the realm of Seattle high-tech, and the realm of 
Pierce County's accused felons.

Weeks later, a man was trying to recruit me to support the data analytics division of a global 
entertainment leader. He realized that he had seen me on the news. He said it was unlikely that I would be 
hired based on what he knew.

# Out on bail

Being out on bail is surreal. Being on bail for a speech crime was another level. Anything I said anywhere
could be used against me.

I think as the deputy prosecutor realized his case was goofy, the plan changed to stalling. the deputy prosecutor would show up 
unprepared for hearings, forcing us to reschedule.

Eventually I got back to the singing groups Emily and I enjoyed before I moved to Tacoma. It was so 
strange to feel safe and respected in Seattle again, while shuttling to Tacoma to face down the 
intransigence of the prosecuting attorney, and endless dishonest 
schemes employed in the custody dispute.

For a while, I seemed to have a double life.

# See Before my verdict

My parents are Pierce County Democrats since forever. The day before my verdict, we 
attended a Dem fundraiser in downtown Tacoma. By pure luck, my assigned seat faced Mark Lindquist. What a surreal 
evening that was for me. He rode his phone all evening long. What a bizarre and insulting argument he made 
to our state's Supreme Court, that the ownership of the phone was a loophole in our laws governing public 
officials. I never asked any judge to believe something so outrageous. He spent tax funds lavishly on his 
ridiculous position while my family spent painfully to counter his ridiculous claim that I should be 
incarcerated. What a surreal culmination, to watch him ride his phone all evening, as a recall 
petition drive threatened him in the street, and I studied and derided his fat head and crazy eyes from 
fifteen feet away. He's a danger because he thinks only he matters. Whatever else is going on, he wants to 
make it about him. He'll put you in a prison if he thinks that's what it takes to keep him safely in the 
public eye.

# See Implications of Lindquist's position

Mark accused me of a speech crime. Speech crimes do exist, and I 
got to learn all about them. The law calls the crime he tried me 
for a *true threat*. You know what I think: He tried me because he 
went on TV and spoke improperly about me, and had to win to paper 
over that bad choice. If we pretend that's untrue, where does that 
leave him? 

It disturbs me that an American would believe seven 
words could and should result in seven felonies and over a year 
behind bars. Any seven words just aren't enough to determine 
intended meaning. Next you'll see him trying someone for the work 
of a smartphone's auto-correct!

Maybe Mark is obsessed with this particular crime. It's a unique 
kind of crime, where symbols and words are the actual crime. 
According to documents, Mark Lindquist [became obsessed with the 
idea that Glenda Nissen committed this same 
crime](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article26298505.html) 
by sending a death threat to Mary Robnett, even though no forensic 
evidence tied her to it, and other details didn't point to her, 
either. 
Maybe as a writer of pulp fiction, he's unusually attached 
to words. 
I 
think Mark has the kind of connection to words and symbols that we 
see in our President. In a post-factual world, symbols don't 
represent or misrepresent the truth. Symbols become truth! It's 
disturbing.

Once I came to know who Mark Lindquist is, and study his 
activities further, I came to expect his two-sentence 
condemnations of criminal incidents in the fake or real press, on 
KIRO FM, or on the TV news. This is a guy who thinks he can reach 
more people with two sentences than with something longer. This is 
a guy who would see the potential for fear or hope from seven words.
That's fine, but it's not enough, and it shouldn't be [an obsession](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article53206345.html).
A Prosecutor shouldn't be so 
wrapped up in perceptions. A Prosecutor should be wrapped up in 
the totality of facts! Convictions, not arrests, should enthuse a 
prosecutor. It's like Pierce County has chosen a prosecutor who 
sees the job like brief appearances on American Idol. 

A prosecutor's job _starts_ with an arrest. It _ends_ with a 
conviction. Mark hypes arrests because he's excited about getting 
media attention. I don't think he cares about the boring work 
of securing honest convictions.
