Today I provided a letter to the Bar 
Association that reports violations of the 
Rules of Professional Conduct, rules 
established by our state's Supreme Court to 
govern the behavior of all lawyers in our 
state.

I've asked the Bar Association to take action 
in response to a clear pattern of malfescence 
by a powerful elected official in his 
professional capacity.

As you may know, in 2015, I was tried for seven 
felonies, for a speech crime. Afer a full trial, I was 
acquitted fully of these specious charges.

My life and career in Seattle remains strong due in 
large part to the substantial, ongoing support of my 
family and friends. I could choose to forget about the 
dark times and struggle that accompanied my arrest, 
life as an accused felon, and full trial in a Tacoma 
courtroom. There are many details of the Prosecutor's 
choices in my case that caused me distress at the 
time. But of greater concern, I've come to learn that 
my experience is not an isolated incident; Mr. 
Lindquist now has a lengthy and growing record of 
malfescence throughout his tenure, including false 
imprisonment, enormous misuse of taxpayer funds, 
prohibited statements about the accused, and bumbling 
failures to convict dangerous men. Most disturbingly, 
even as evidence mounts, like a common criminal, he 
denies it all.

I am disurbed that he calls himself a good 
Democrat, and I'm burdened with the knowledge 
that most people accused of serious crimes 
cannot shoulder the burden of a criminal trial, 
even when falsely accused. Facts are the 
beginning and end of a sound prosecution, yet 
Mr. Lindquist has shown a very loose and 
opportunistic relationship with the facts.

To inform my friends and the general public, 
I've made my full letter available online. I 
look forward to communicating further with all 
of you as this matter unfolds.
