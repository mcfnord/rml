Conclusions of Law:

FINDINGS OF FACT

BACKGROUND

2.1 On July 26, 2011. Pierce County Sheriff‘s Department (“PCSD”) Detective
Glenda Nissen (“‘Det. Nissen”) settled her whistleblower complaint against Pierce County
Prosecuting Attorney (“PCPA”) Mark Lindquist and his office, the Pierce County Prosecuting
Attorney’s Office (“PCPAO”). Mell 02/12/2018 Dec. Ex. 2 (Settlement Agreement.) The
allegations in Det. Nissen’s whistleblower complaint were, inter alia, that <mark>PCPOA Lindquist
restricted her from the prosecutor’s office and targeted her for criminal prosecution because she
did not support his campaign to become Pierce County’s prosecutor.</mark>

2.2 The settlement document included Pierce County’s promise of no retaliation. Mell
02/ 12/2018 Dec. Ex. 2 (Settlement Agreement at 1 “Pierce County agrees that Ms. Nissen will
not be retaliated against for bringng forward her claims”)

2.3 The parties agreed to neutral press statements. Mell 02/ 12/2018 Dec. Ex. 3 (Humphrey
Report at 7, Humphrey Witness Interview Summary Lindquist 12/ 19/ 11, Humphrey Witness
hiterview Summary Ladenburg 02/ 12).

2.4 On August 1, 2011, TNT Reporter Adam Lynn contacted the parties for comment. Mell
02/12/2018 Dec. Ex. 4 (Lynn E—Mail to Mell).

2.5 On or about August 2, 2011, Det. Nissen’s attorney contacted Pierce County’s Risk
Manager Mark Maenhout reminding him that the parties had agreed to neutral press statements
and that Pierce County’s proposed non-neutral press statement prepared by the prosecutor’s
office violated that agreement:

“Workplace safety is of paramount importance to Pierce County. This concern is
addressed by the Prosecutor‘s Office new security access policy, effective July 26, 201 l,
the date of the settlement agreement. The 2.5 million dollar claim filed against the
County by the Sheriff‘s detective as been dropped, and the detective received no money
herself. The County made a business decision to pay medication fees and costs of
$39,500 to avoid the high expense of several hundred thousand dollars necessary to
litigate even a meritless claim.”

Mell 02/ 12/2018 Dec. Ex. 3 (Humphrey Witness Interview Summary Maenhout 12/16/11 at 14

“In the meantime, the reporter had sent it to Joan and she went crazy”) and Ex. 4 (Lynn E-Mail
to Mell).

2.6 On August 2, 2011, PCPA Lindquist contacted Pierce County Communications Director
Hunter George about proposed changes to the above press statement with Lindquist’s concerns
that the proposed neutral statement was inadequate without the comments negative to Det.
Nissen that his office had proposed. Mell 02/12/2018 Dec. Ex. 5 (George E-Mails) and Ex. 6
(TNT Coverage).

2.7 Pierce County’s Risk Manager offered a new neutral statement that the TNT published:

“The settlement is a business decision. The county agreed to pay mediation fees and
costs of $39,500 to avoid the high expense oflitigating any claim.” Mell 12/12/2018 Dec.
Ex. 5 (George E-Mail) and Ex. 6 (TNT 08/02/11 Pierce County settles retaliation claim
against Lindquist for $39,500).

On August 2, 2011 in the evening, The News Tribune first covered the settlement
online.

2.8 The online coverage included a sentence to the effect that the PCSD had not verified a
suspect responsible for a threatening letter received by Lindquist’s Chief Criminal Deputy
Prosecutor Mary Robnett. Mell 02/12/2018 Dec. Ex. 7 (Robnett Dec. at 3).

2.9 On August 2, 2011 at 11:51 p.m., PCPA Lindquist used his personal cell phone that he
used for work purposes to text Chief Criminal DPA Robnett “tell allies to comment on tnt story.”
Mell 02/12/2018 Dec. Ex. 7 (Robnett Dec- Text Transcript).

2.10 On August 2, 2011 at PCPA Lindquist contacted PCSD Public Information Officer
Edward Troyer to have that sentence changed to label Nissen responsible for the letter. Mell

02/12/2018 Dec. Ex. 7 (Robnett Dec. at 3); and Ex. 12 (Mell Cease and Desist Ltr. to Troyer).

2.11 The next morning August 3, 2011, The TNT’s print publication was delivered with the

sentence changed as PCPA Mark Lindquist had requested linking Det. Nissen to the letter:

“Nissen was being investigated as a **** in a death threat made against Lindquist’s chief

criminal deputy prosecutor when he banned her from the office." Mell 02/12/2018 Dec. Ex. 6

(TNT 08/03/11 Coverage) & Ex. 3 (Humphrey Report at 7.)

NISSEN I PRR

2.12 On August 3, 2011, Det. Nissen, through counsel, requested phone records and texts

messages for August 2, 201 1 from PCPA Mark Lindquist’s personal cell phone (253-861-86XX)

or any other cellular telephone he used to conduct his business. Nissan v. Pierce County, 183

W11.2d 863, 869, 357 P.3d 45 (Aug. 27, 2015).

2.13 On August 3, 2011, Det. Nissen‘s attorney sent a preservation request to Verizon. Mell

03/14/2017 Dec. Ex. B (Mell Ltr to Verizon). Verizon preserved texts between July 29, 2011 to

August 4, 2011. Mel] 03/14/2017 Dec. Ex. B (Verizon Acknowledgement).
2.14 On August 3, 2011 at 5:23 pm, deputy prosecuting attorney Michael Sommerfeld,

posted under the pseudonym “porfirypetrovich” the following negative comments to the TNT

website relating to the coverage of the Nissen settlement:

“More than frivolous. Mark Maenhout should be thanked for settling this for the small
sum of $40k in mediation fees. This prevents Joan Mell from extorting County tax

payers into spending $250,000.00 or more to prove that her lawsuit is ridiculous. And for

Joan Mell to describe safety precautions taken by Lindquist to protect his staff as “antics”
reveals how juvenile and petty she is about a serious matter. She should recall that the

original article stated that the measures were taken only after detectives from the Pierce

County Sheriff Dept. identified her client as the xxxxsxx. This was not “retaliation” for
supporting another candidate who probably couldn‘t beat Dale Washam in a head to head

race. It was a cautious response based upon infonnation provided to the prosecutor’s
office by the sheriff dept. As Maenhout said, this was a “business decision” and clearly a

cheap one for the taxpayers. And not one dime is being paid to Nissen if you read the
agreement.” Mell 2/12/2018 Dec. EX. 10 (porfrrypetrovich posted on 08/03/2011
w/redaction.) Mell 02/ 12/2018 Dec. Ex. 10 (Porflry Comment).

2.15 On August 3, 2011 at 7:43 pm, DPA Sommerfeld tested PCPA Lindquist at his

personal cell phone "It. is posted now” and PCPA Lindquist responded at 9:01 p.m.: ”Doesn‘t

come up. What‘s the name?” Mell 02/12/2018 Dec. Ex. 11 (Text Transcript).
2.16 On August 4, 2011, Det. Nissen’s attorney Mell sent a cease and desist and preservation

notification letter to PCSD Public Information Officer (“1310") Edward Troyer. Mell 02/12/2018

Dec. Ex. 12 (Mell Letter to Troyer).
2.17 On August 4, 2011, PCSD P10 Troyer tested PCPA Lindquist at his personal cell phone:
"Check your work email. Also I got a nasty letter from joan mel." and Lindquist responded:

"Call me" Mell 02/12/2018 Dec. Ex. 11 (Text Transcript).

2.18 On August 29, 2011, Det. Nissen filed a whistleblower retaliation complaint alleging,

inter alia, that PCPA Lindquist manipulated the TNT coverage of her case. Nissan v. Lindqnisr

at. a], ECF Case No. 3:16acv-05093-BHS
2.19 On or about August 25, 2011, in response to her Nissan I request, PCPA Lindquist
obtained and provided the County with a call log and a text log that the County produced to Bet.

Nissen. Nissan 1. 183 Wn.2d at 870. The text log did not reveal the content of the messages, but

did provide the date and time of each message and the corresponding party with some redactions.

2.21 On or about October 3, 2011, Pierce County retained an attorney, Lawton Humphrey, to

investigate the retaliation complaint Det. Nissen submitted wherein she claimed PCPA Lindquist

and his office manipulated the TNT coverage of her case in violation of her settlement
agreement. Mell Dec. Ex. 3 (Excerpts Humphrey Report and Statements).

2.22 On October 26, 2011, Det. Nissen filed her initial PRA case now known as Nissan 1, 183
Wn.2d 863, 357 P.3d 45 (Aug. 27, 2015). After remand from the Supreme Court, the trial court
found that PCPA Lindquist’s August 2, 2011 at 11:51 pm. text message to Chief DPA Robnett
“tell allies to comment on tnt article” was a public record. Nissan 1 February 19, 2016 (Order).
Neither that finding nor the final order awarding attorney fees and penalties was appealed.

Rejecting the County’s appeal of the denial of sanctions against Nissen, Division 11 found that

Det. Nissen and her counsel had not made false statements as alleged by Pierce County. Id. at =1‘5

and ftnts 5 and 6.

2.61 On February 9, 2016, the Nissen I trial court issued a letter opinion on in camera review

that the “tell allies” text was a public record.

2.62 On February 19, 2016, the Division II opinion became final. Division 11 issued its

mandate on Nissan 11 on March 22, 2016.

2.63 On February 19, 2016, the Nissen I court entered its Order on SMS Messages Transcript

finding the text from PCPA Lindquist to PCPAO DPA Robnett at 11:51 pm. “tell allies to

comment on tnt story” a public record.

2.64 On March 18, 2016, the Nissen I court declared Glenda Nissen the prevailing party and

awarded her attorney’s fees, costs, and penalties. On April 1, 2016 it entered its final order. The

rates it used for attomeys fees were $375.00 and $460.00 per hour. Neither party appealed these
orders after the Supreme Court declined to recall its mandate on June 1, 2016.

2.65 On January 11, 2017, Det. Nissen moved to compel discovery and in camera review of

the text transcripts. Her motion was denied. The Court entered an order setting a briefing

schedule regarding the sufficiency of the Lindquist declaration.

2.66 On July 17, 2017, the Court found the 03/28/2016 Declaration of Prosecutor Mark

Lindquist re: SMS Transcripts was insufficient under Nissen I. The insufficiencies included (i)

the failure to provide an explanation of each individual text sufficient to explain the
communication as private and not public; (ii) the failure to indicate whether each text was from

or to a public employee; and, (iii) that PCPA Lindquist “largely relies on his own determination

Lindquist after seeking a continuance for extra time to file a second declaration.
2.68 On August 22, 2017. Counsel for Nissen submitted briefing to the court stating that the

August 4. 2011 text message between Lindquist and Ed Troyer was a reference to the letter that

Counsel for Nissen sent to Ed Troyer on that very day. (8/22/2017 Nissen’s Brief on the

Insufficiency of PCPA Mark Lindquist’s Suppl. Declaration at 8.) Nissen also explained that
there was likely a text between Sommerfeld and Lindquist on the TNT coverage. The County

continued to oppose production of these work related texts on the same content as the Nissan 1

text.

2.69 On December 12, 2017. the Court ruled that the 08/15/17 Supplemental Declaration of
Mark Lindquist re: SMS Transcripts was still insufficient and ordered seventeen texts produced
for in camera review by January 5, 2018. The Court also ruled that the August 2, 201 1 text “tell

allies to comment on tnt story” was a public record and ordered Pierce County to produce it to

Det. Nissen.

2.70 The County did not immediately produce the public records to Bet. Nissen. (Nissen

2.95 Pierce County did not submit any declarations from its Public Records Ombudsman or its

declarations of PCPA Mark Lindquist.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Glenda Nissen The Prevailing Party

3.1 Plaintiff Glenda Nissen is the prevailing party on appeal and at the trial court level. She

is entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees, costs, and penalties under RCW 42.56.550(4) at both

levals- A -\-\u>r won :dmkiuri h "3"" (“AB ”1/“ #4 03'!

3.2 The ten texts attached at Appendix ,B’ are public records under the PRA that were

responsive to Glenda Nissen’s public disclosure request that Pierce County should have made

available to Nissen in reSponse to her request. Mark Lindquist and the other senders and

recipients had no privacy interest in these public record texts.

Attorney’s Fees and Costs Reasonable and Necessary

3.3 Attorney’s fees calculated at the rates of $375.00 per hour for Joan K. Mell and $400.00

per hour for William J. Crittenden are reasonable. Paralegal rates in the amount of $175.00 per

hour are reasonable.

3.4 Ms. Nissen’s costs incurred were both reasonable and necessarily incurred.

3.5 Glenda Nissen necessarily incurred the fees and costs billed from each firm in the amounts

set forth in the Mell and Crittenden declarations. The time each firm expended representing

Glenda Nissen was necessary to Dot. Nissen prevailing in these proceedings. The amount of

time allocated to the representation of Glenda Nissen was reasonable.

Glenda Nissen’s

attomey’s fees are awarded in whole with the following limited exceptions: The fee award shall

3.8 Pierce County failed to conduct a reasonable search for public records because it did

nothing more than rely upon two declarations from Prosecuting Attorney Mark Lindquist that
were insufficient to meet the affidavit requirements set forth in Nissan I. Pierce County should

have returned the insufficient declarations to PCPA Lindquist and asked him to supplement

them.

er 5u§§oxM

3.9 PCPA Mark Lindquist did not comply with the PRA in that he did not accurately describe
A

the content or context of the text messages, and he withheld public record texts. PCPA

Lind uist’s declarations were ar mentatiye in nature and were written from a law er’s

perspective with an apparent effort to direct the Court to a particular conclusion without

presenting all the necessary information of the conclusion Lindquist desired the Court to reach.

penalties. The issues on pre-appeal fees. costs, and penalties are identical in Nissan 1 and Nissan

11 and the Nissan I court finally decided pre-appeal fees, costs, and penalties may be awarded.
3.12 The Court has considered the arguments made by the parties as to the amount of statutory

penalties to be awarded and the aggravating and mitigating factors set forth in Yonsonfian v. Ron
Siinins, 168 Wn.2d 444, 459, 229 P.3d 735 (2010). The mitigating and aggravating factors were
reviewed and applied to the facts of this case for purposes of setting the applicable penalty rate.
3.13 The public records are appropriately grouped for purposes of calculating the penalty into
three categories: the public defender texts; the Joan Mell letter related texts, and the texts related
to the “portiry” comments on the TNT coverage of the Nissen/Pierce County settlement.

3.14 The penalty rate for the time period from the date of Glenda Nissen’s public records

request on December 9. 2011 to the date of mandate on March 22, 2016 shall be lower than the

time period after the mandate to the date Pierce County produced the records on February 2,

2018. The rationale for a different penalty rate includes the questions of first impression and

unsettled law.

3.15 The primary consideration in determining the penalty amount was to discourage improper

denial of access to public records and encourage adherence to the goals and procedures dictated

by the statute.

3.16 The fifty dollar per day penalty imposed in Nissan 1 for the second period of time was not

sufficient to encourage compliance with the PRA, and did not deter Pierce County‘s violations of

the PRA.

3.17 The record does not reflect conduct, actions, or words since Nissan I to support a finding
that Pierce County has improved its compliance with the PRA or that Pierce County’s

compliance with the PRA will improve in the future.
