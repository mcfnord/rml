Mr. Steve Merrival  
PO Box 1656  
Tacoma, WA 98401  

Dear Mr. Merrival,

The Pierce County Human Resources (HR) Department received a complaint tiled by you alleging
misconduct committed or endorsed by the Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney. Your complaint, received
on May 13, 2015, was filed with the Washington State Auditor’s Office and the Pierce County Human
Resources Department.

As established by the Pierce County Charter, Title 2, the Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office is a
sepa rately—elected County office and is not an executive branch department of the County. As such, this
substantially limits the authority of the Pierce County Executive and executive departments to oversee
the office of an independently elected county official. Pierce County Charter, Article 3, further removes
the administrative authority of the executive branch over elected—office staffing and Operations. The
PCPAO employees serve at will and at the discretion of the elected county Prosecutor, unless represented
by the PCDPA Association. However, county code vests authority in the HR department to receive and
take action as appropriate on Whistleblower and Equal Employment Opportunity complaints.

My office reviewed the complaints and determined that based on the complexity, nature, and extent of
the allegations, an independent investigation was necessary. The investigation conducted by Mr. Busto is
now complete and attached. in light of findings in this report and due to the jurisdictional limitations
outlined above, I have made several recommendations for the Prosecuting Attorney’s consideration.
Additionally, because there are findings included in the report that potentially implicate the Pierce County
Code of Ethics, I will be sending a copy to the county Ethics Commission.

Please be reminded that retaliation is specifically prohibited. Any form of retaliation against the
complainant(s) and/or any person who participates in a complaint or investigation is prohibited by law
and a person who has been subjected to retaliatory action may obtain appropriate relief as defined in
RCW 42.41.040.

Sincerely,

Ginny Dale  
Pierce County Human Resources Director

# See Report of Investigation

October 22, 2015

Pierce County requested that I investigate whistleblower/personnel complaints against
Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist. This is the report of my investigation.

The first whistleblower complaint, dated May 12, 2015, was filed by Deputy Prosecuting
Attorney (“DPA”) Steve Merrival with you and Jim Brownell, Whistleblower Manager of the
State Auditor’s Office (“Merrival Complaint”). The Merrival Complaint generally claimed that
<mark>Lindquist<sup>1</sup> engaged in “misconduct and retaliation,” created a “hostile work environment,”
interfered with “collective bargaining” and disregarded “merit based employment.”</mark> The second
whistleblower complaint, dated May 21, 2015, was filed by Chief Criminal Deputy Stephen
Penner with you and Mr. Brownell (“Penner Complaint”). The Penner Complaint generally
claimed that <mark>Lindquist violated federal, state and county law, and engaged in “gross waste of
public funds” and an “abuse of authority.”<sup>2</sup></mark>

<hr>

<sup>1</sup> For ease of reference, I will use last names throughout the report.

<sup>2</sup> Both Merrival and Penner and other Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney Office (“PCPAO”) employees
subsequently filed claims alleging retaliation. This report does not include those claims.

# See Findings of Fact

**Findings of Fact<sup>3</sup>**

**I. Alleged Violations of Federal, State and County Law<sup>4</sup>**

**A. “Brady” Violations<sup>5</sup>**

**1. PCPAO PIE Policy.**

_**Allegation**_: The Merrival Complaint alleged that the PCPAO’S policies and procedures
related to the disclosure of potential impeachment evidence (“PIE”) are inadequate in the
following respects: PIE information is not timely disclosed, which deprives a defendant of the
benefit of the PIE when considering a plea; the PIE policy has not been effectively
communicated to DPAs; and, the identity of PIE witnesses are unknown to DPAs.

_**Summary of the Findings of Fact:**_ The County’s LINX database system notifies DPAs
that a witness has PIE when the witness is subpoenaed to appear at trial; DPAs are not notified in
advance of trial at a time when many, if not most pleas are negotiated<sup>6</sup> the PCPAO did not
distribute the policy to DPAs; and, the PCPAO does not maintain a list of designated PIE
witnesses.

_**Summmary of the Evidence:**_ PCPAO adopted a PIE policy on September 17, 2013 based
on the Model Policy of the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys (“WAPA”).<sup>7</sup>
Upon adoption, representatives of the PCPAO met with each law enforcement agency in the
County and the law enforcement officers” guilds to discuss the policy and to address any
concerns. According to many witnesses, including Penner and Judge Phillip Sorenson who were
responsible for developing and implementing the policy, the process was difficult because every
PIE policy must balance the constitutional rights of criminal defendants and the concerns of law
enforcement about officers’ privacy and reputations.

For example, the PCPAO does not maintain a list of “Brady officers,” largely due to the
resistance of the officers and their guilds. Instead, the PCPAO sends a letter annually to every
law enforcement agency in the County requesting that they supply the PCPAO with any PIE of
which they are aware. If the PCPAO hears about possible PIE from other sources, such as
criminal defense attorneys, the office sends the law enforcement agency an email requesting the
information. The PCPAO then forwards the information to the involved individual to give
him/her an opportunity to respond.

<hr>

<sup>3</sup> I have been asked to reach findings of fact and not conclusions of law.  
<sup>4</sup> The organization of the report generally tracks the Merrival Complaint.  
<sup>5</sup> “Brady“ is a reference to Brady v. Maryland, 373 US 83 (1983). Bruce); and its progeny impose an affirmative
duty on prosecutors to disclose Potential Impeachment Evidence (“PIE”) to a charged defendant.  
<sup>6</sup> Whether DPAs are notified “too late” is an issue of law, which I do not decide, and opinion, which I do not offer.  
<sup>7</sup> An earlier policy adopted during the Home administration dealt with the more limited obligation under Brady to
disclose exculpatory evidence.

# See PIE information

The PCPAO has created a committee of senior leadership that reviews all PIE
information. Penner chairs the committee and schedules meetings to discuss the information
received. The committee determines whether the information is PIE and, if so, it identifies the
individual in LINX, the county-wide database of court filings and other case data. When the
individual is listed as a witness and subpoenaed for trial, LINX sends an email “flag” to the
responsible DPA, who is instructed to discuss the PIE with Penner. The DPA and Penner review
the case and Penner decides whether disclosure is required.

The PIE policy was not distributed to DPAs when adopted; rather, the PCPAO distributed
a single sheet summarizing the policy to team chiefs and asked them to discuss the policy with
their DPAs. The procedure appears to have been ineffective because most DPAs interviewed
stated that they were unaware of the PIE policy. All they recalled was a requirement “to call
Penner.“<sup>8</sup>

The system, as one might expect, is not foolproof. For example, Merrival described a
case involving a defense attorney who notified him that one of the witnesses listed by the
PCPAO was a PIE officer. Penner determined that the List of Witnesses in the case was dated
September 11, 2014 and the LINX notice was sent to the DPA on September 24, 2014. He was
unable to determine why the “flag” was delayed two weeks.

Many DPAs echoed Merrival’s opinion that PIE should be disclosed as soon as possible
so that defense counsel know their leverage during plea bargainng and can properly advise
clients. In other words, according to these DPAs, disclosing PIE when trial subpoenas go out is
too late to protect the rights of the criminal defendant. Others witnesses maintained that
defendants have a right to the information at the time of trial only; when criminal defendants
enter a plea, they give up their legal arguments and the right to review all of the evidence. I will
not opine on the law as it relates to PIE, but note that DPA Brian Leech said that the Pierce
County policy is similar to the Kitsap and King County policies, which likewise take the position
that PIE is not required to be disclosed until trial.

Finally, even if the PIE is disclosed, DPAs uniformly stated that they routinely file
motions to exclude the evidence at trial. The trial judge determines the ultimate question of the
admissibility of the PIE.

<hr>

<sup>8</sup> One DPA said that attorneys in the Misdemeanor Division received training on PIE.

# See 2. Vengeful Application of the PIE Policy.

_**Allegation**_: The Merrival Complaint alleged that Lindquist “publically and aggressively
labeled the two officers known to be critical of him as ‘Brady’ officers” (Amos and Wood), but
not other officers whose honesty has been questioned, _i.e._, Detective Debbie Heishman. I
address each of these allegations below.

_**Summary of the Findings of Fact**_: The designation of Detective Mike Amos as a PIE
officer is the subject of litigation so I will not review it here; Lindquist was frustrated with
Detective Sgt. Wood’s investigation of the Robnett death threat, discussed more fully below, but
Wood’s designation as a PIE officer resulted from his own misconduct and was not done for
improper reasons; and, the PCPAO had not designated Detective Debbie Heischman as a PIE
officer prior to the Merrival Complaint because Penner had not received notice of any PIE
pertaining to her, but the office has subsequently designated Heischman upon review of the
evidence.

_**Summmary of the Evidence**_: I review the evidence related to each of the detectives below.

**a. Detective Mike Ames.** The PCPAO has identified Ames as a PIE
officer. The PIE includes: declarations signed by Ames in Dalsing v. Pierce County that contain
allegations that are disputed in signed declarations filed by civil DPAs assigned to the case; and,
a report of investigation of allegations by Amos against employees of the PCPAO and the PCSD
that concluded there was “no evidence” to support the claims.

The _Dalsing v. Pierce County_ civil litigation is ongoing. In addition, the appeal of the
dismissal of Ames‘ “name-clearing“ action, brought specifically to determine if “dishonest,
unfounded, unsupported accusations of dishonesty... [is] Brady material,” was recently argued in
Division II of the Court of Appeals.<sup>9</sup> Under these circumstances, where multiple courts will
reach findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding Ames’ PIE information, <mark>I will not review
it here</mark>.

# See Detective Sgt. Denny Wood


**b. Detective Sgt. Denny Wood:** The PCPAU has identified Wood as
a PIE officer. The PIE is summarized in a letter that includes nineteen allegations for which Sgt.
Scott Provost, who signed the letter, stated there was a factual basis. The allegations involve a
relationship between Wood and the widow of a homicide victim in a case where Wood was the
lead detective. The PCSD subsequently conducted an internal investigation of Wood’s conduct,
which resulted in his demotion and suspension. According to witnesses from the PCSD and the
PCPAO, Wood compromised the homicide investigation and the disclosure of PIE regarding his
conduct was wholly appropriate.

Wood acknowledged that his conduct “got him in trouble with the Department,“ but said
that the PIE letter signed by Provost was mitten by the PCPAO for the purpose of embarrassing
him. Wood said that Lindquist targeted him because Wood refused to cooperate with
Lindquist’s goals in the investigation of a death threat against then Chief Criminal Deputy Mary
Robnett. According to Wood, Lindquist’s goals were to identify Detective Nissen as the sole
suspect in the death threat investigation and to determine whether DPA Lisa Wagner was
providing internal, PCPAO information to Nissen.<sup>10</sup> As evidence of Lindquist’s desire to
identify Nissen as the sole suspect, Wood said (and former DPA Craig Adams confirmed) that
the PCPAO asked Wood to sign a declaration in response to a civil action brought by Nissen
indicating that Nissen was the only suspect in the investigation. Wood said the statement was
not true and demanded that it be changed. Wood also cited examples of Lindquist and his staff
resisting Wood’s efforts to identify and investigate other possible suspects, including a DPA with
a history of conflict with Robnett.

Regarding Wagner, Wood said that Lindquist called him and demanded his investigation
report before he submitted it; Wood responded that he had never done that before and it would
be improper if he did; and, the case was going to a different county for review, so Lindquist
didn’t need the information. According to Wood, Lindquist told him he didn’t need it for
prosecution; he needed it to make decisions in his office about personnel, _i.e._, DPA Wagner.

Lindquist said that his only concern during the investigation was to determine who sent
the death threat (“we go where the evidence leads”); that Robnett was “110% convinced” Nissen
was the author of the death threat; and, that his goal was to support Robnett, his Chief Criminal
Deputy.<sup>11</sup> Lindquist further stated that he did not care if the Sheriff’s Dept. investigated Wagner;
that he expected that people vent about issues; and, that Wagner did not disclose any confidential
information, so was not concerned about her venting.

 
<hr>

<sup>10</sup> The death threat was sent shortly after Nissen wrote an email critical of Lindquist and the PCPAO, which was the
principal reason the PCSD identified her as a suspect.  
<sup>11</sup> However, Lindquist admitted that he asked the County spokesman to request that the TNT remove a statement
from an article that the death threat investigation had not identified a suspect.

# See Nissen

<mark>Robnett, the object of the death threat, confirmed that both she and Lindquist believed
that Nissen sent the death threat and were concerned that the PCSD was not doing enough to
investigate the matter. Robnett also recalled that Lindquist wanted to know whether Wagner
provided Nissen with the information contained in the email Nissen sent to the TNT critical of
Lindquist and the PCPAO. Robnett described Lindquist’s insistence on finding Nissen’s
information source as off-putting, misdirected and very strong — “not the way a prosecutor would
talk to experienced detectives.”</mark>

<mark>As further evidence of Lindquist's singular focus on Nissen as a suspect, Robnett said
that Lindquist “kind of flipped out” when Nissen filed a Public Records Act (“PRA”) action
against the County after the settlement of her civil suit against Lindquist. Robnett said that she
had considered filing a lawsuit against Nissen at the time of the civil suit but later decided
against it. Nevertheless, Lindquist continued to press Robnett to sue Nissen. The conversation
came to a head in October 2011. Robnett had a pointed discussion with Lindquist, told him that
she was not prepared to sue Nissen and then left on a long road trip. She decided during the trip
that she could no longer work for Lindquist and the PCPAO and resigned upon her return.</mark>

Commissioner and former DPA Craig Adams reported that the PCSD got a tip that
another person associated with the “Craig’s List” murder cases (which Robnett prosecuted) could
have authored the death threat. Adams recalled that he was called into a meeting with Lindquist,
Farina, Robnett and his superiors in the Civil Division<sup>12</sup> and was questioned about his
conversations with the Sheriff about the new suspect. Adams, who was the DPA assigned to the
PCSD, said that his communications with the Sheriff were privileged and he could not disclose
them unless the Sheriff waived the privilege. Lindquist dismissed Adams and asked the Sheriff
to join the meeting, where Lindquist and his staff requested he waive the privilege. The Sheriff
refused. Lindquist summoned Adams again and asked him to produce other evidence about the
investigation of the “Craig’s List” suSpeet. Adams said that Lindquist and the others were upset
at the existence of another suspect that could exonerate Nissen. They were also “very pissed off”
at him for not disclosing the privileged communication about the alternative suspect; and, they
told him he was not a “team player“ because he had a duty to inform them about anything that
could affect the PCPAO.

Robnett confirmed that Lindquist was very unhappy with Adams because of his refusal to
disclose his conversations with the Sheriff. Lindquist complained that Adams was not
effectively communicating the Prosecutor’s position to the PCSD and suggested to Doug
Vanscoy, Adams” supervisor, that Adams” office needed to be moved back to the PCPAO
because he was getting too cozy with the PCSD.<sup>13</sup> Lindquist also suggested that Adams should
be replaced at the PCSD and possibly terminated.<sup>14</sup> Adams, knowing that he had angered
Lindquist, soon thereafter took a position as a Pierce County Superior Court Commissioner and
left the PCPAO after 20 years in his position.

Finally, Mike Sonnnerfeld, the DPA assigned to the PCSD, said that Penner sent him a
letter inquiring about PIE information involving Wood. He said that he used the PCSD’s internal
affairs investigation report as a basis for a letter he drafted to Penner summarizing the PIE
information in the PCSD’s possession. Sgt. Provost said that he worked with Sommerfeld to edit
the letter and was satisfied that all the information in it was accurate, so he signed it and sent it to
Penner. Penner said that Wood’s PIE letter, dated May 8, 2013, was unusual in its specificity
and unlike any he has seen during his tenure as Chief Criminal Deputy. However, he said that
the PCPAO had not finalized its PIE policy at the time and had no established protocols for the
submission of PIE. Sommerfeld, Penner and Provost all denied having any basis for believing
that the letter was written to embarrass Wood.

In light of this evidence, I fmd that Lindquist sought to focus the PCSD'S investigation of
the Robnett death threat on Nissen and away from other possible suspects; and, Lindquist
attempted to secure evidence during the investigation that Wagner supplied information about
the PCPAO to Nissen.<sup>15</sup> However, I also further find the PCPAO had a legitimate basis for
identifying Wood as a PIE officer and the PIE letter its DPA helped draft was not intended to
embarrass him, notwithstanding any hustration that Lindquist had regarding Wood’s
investigation of Nissen.

<hr>

<sup>12</sup> Lindquist’s personal attorney attended the meeting by telephone.  
<sup>13</sup> Adams’ office was physically located at the PCSD.
<sup>14</sup> Robnett recalled that Vansccy, to his credit, “stood up to Lindquist” and said, “If Adams says it’s privileged, then it is.”  
<sup>15</sup> _See also_, "Lindquist Involvement in Deputy Investigation at Center of Phone Records Case", Tacoma News Tribune, June 10, 2015.


# See c. Detective Debbie Heischman

According to Penner, Detective
Heischman retired on February 29, 2012. Her last case was the Dalsing case, in which she made
a statement based on personal knowledge that the room in the photograph used by the PCPAO to
identify and charge Dalsing was, in fact, Dalsing’s bedroom. As it turned out, the bedroom in
the photo was clearly not Dalsing’s, based on obvious characteristics of her bedroom, which
made Heischman’s statement sufficiently suspect to warrant disclosure as PIE.

After Merrival filed his Complaint and identified Heischman as an officer who should
have been identified as a “Brady officer”, Penner set up a meeting of the PIE committee on June
2, 2015 to discuss her. They reviewed the Dalsing materials (the probable cause declaration and
relevant police reports) and other evidence and ultimately concluded that the Dalsing materials
needed to be disclosed as PIE. The PCPAO has now identified her as a PIE officer. When
Penner was asked about the delay in designating her, he said the PIE issue was never presented
to the PCPAO, probably because _Dalsing_ was the last case before her retirement. I credit
Penner’s explanation and, given the circumstances of Heischman’s retirement, I conclude that
the PCPAO did not fail to designate Heischman a PIE officer for improper reasons.

# See Intimidating Public Servants/Witnesses

_**B. Intimidating Public Servants/Witnesses**_

_**Allegation**_: The Merrival Complaint alleged that,

<ul>On or about May lst of 2014 in the matter of Ames v. Pierce County, 13-2-13551—
1 a number of members of the local bar filed declarations to oppose efforts to
sanction Det. Ames and his attorney for seeking a name clearing hearing against
the PCPAO. When the declarations were filed, PCPAO leadership disseminated a
list of the declarants to DPAs. Supervisors instructed DPAs to discriminate
against these declarants and treat them poorly. Those DPAs who chose not to act
improperly, who questioned this directive, and failed to comply with the directive
have been and continue to be admonished.</ul>

Penner’s Complaint added that Lindquist dubbed the attorneys who submitted declarations
(“declarants”) the “confederacy of dunces” and instructed team leaders not to give them good
deals.

_Summary of the Findings of Fact_: Lindquist called the declarants in the Ames name-
clearing matter the “confederacy of duncesf’ Felony Division Chief John Sheeran sent a letter to
the declarants stating that they were mistaken about the facts stated in their declarations; the
PCPAO made the declarations available for DPAs to review and Team Chiefs shared the
declarants’ names with DPAs, but they did not circulate a list of declarants; senior leaders told
Team Chiefs to tell DPAs that the declarants could not be trusted because they lied about their
fellow DPAs, so be wary of them and get things in writing; Lindquist told Penner to tell trial
negotiators not to give the declarants “good deals,” but later retracted the directive when Penner
gave him the opportunity; DPAs in the Special Assault Unit (“SAU”) were told not to give the
declarants any “special treatment” or “special favors,” which was intended to mean that DPAs
should treat them like any other criminal defense lawyer; and, senior leaders admonished
numerous DPAs and staff members for treating the declarants sociably, in a manner befitting
their long-term professional relationship.

_Summary of the Evidence_: It is undisputed that Lindquist and his senior staff met with
PCPAO leadership about the declarations filed by members of the local bar in the Arnes name—
clearing hearing. Lindquist admitted that he used the phrase “confederacy of dances” to describe
the declarants because he believed some of them made allegations of misconduct against DPAs
without personal knowledge.<sup>16</sup> Lindquist claimed that the “dunces'” reference was an attempt to
bring levity to a rancorous situation. However, according to witnesses in leadership positions,
Lindquist firmly believed that Gary Clower was the leader of the group; he said in conversations
about the declarants that Bryan Hershman had personal issues; he said “nothing but negative
things about Joan Mell,“ Ames’ attorney; and, he was generally pejorative when talking about
the group. I find under these circumstances that Lindquist intended the “confederacy of dunces”
phrase to be derogatory and not humorous, as claimed.

In any event, witnesses largely recalled the same message Lindquist and his senior staff
delivered to the leadership. Sheeran said that the message to team chiefs was: the declarants
have maligned your coworkers and accused them of unethical conduct without personal
knowledge; you have to be wary of them because they will malign you, too, and challenge your
integrity; be aware of the situation but don’t take that out on their clients; communicate with
them in writing; and, they would do the same thing to you if they thought it would benefit them
or their client. There is no evidence that senior leadership told the leadership at the meeting not
to give their client good deals. One senior leader said that s/he would have recalled such an
instruction because, “There is no way I would sit for it.”

Sheeran also said that the idea for the PCPAO to communicate directly with the
declarants came up in a leadership meeting. He offered to draft a letter, which he sent to all
declarants in various forms. The letter stated that s/he filed a declaration containing mistaken
assertions; it provided information to the declarants about the case; and, it enclosed declarations
filed by DPAs at the hearing. Witnesses could not recall the PCPAO ever sending a similar letter
to declarants in a civil action.

Penner recalled that Lindquist specifically asked him to go to the negotiators for the trial
teams and tell them that the declarants should not be getting good deals during plea bargaining.
Penner alleged in the Complaint that the instruction followed a conversation with Lindquist
involving a high profile embezzlement case: the DPA assigned was Asst. Team Chief Frank
Krall; defendant’s counsel was Gary Clower. Penner said that the defendant had paid sufficient
restitution to bring down the amount of stolen property below the $5,000 guideline for
participation in the office’s diversion program. Penner told Krall that he should treat the case
like any other, so Krall agreed to dismiss the case to diversion. Penner said that Lindquist was
upset with him and Krall because he did not want the media reporting that the case had been
dismissed, particularly when the defendant was represented by Clower.

Krall recalled Penner telling him that he should treat the embezzlement case coming up
like any other, which Krall thought was odd because he didn’t know any reason why he would
treat it differently. However, after he sent the case to diversion, Sheeran told him that he should
not send cases to diversion that involve “taxpayer money.” Krall responded to Sheeran, “I didn’t
know that there was such a policy.” Krall said he has the heaviest caseload in the office and had
historically sent a lot of welfare fiaud and other taxpayer money cases to diversion. He surmised
that the “policy” probably resulted from two facts: the case involved taxpayer money, and, the
defendant was represented by Clower. Krall wondered, “If the case involved taxpayer money,
why didn’t they tell me their concern beforehand?”

In any event, Penner said that during his conversation with Lindquist about the
embezzlement case, Lindquist instructed him to tell the negotiators (like Krall) that the
declarants (like Clower) should not get good deals. Penner said that he was so concerned with
Lindquist’s request that he discussed the matter with counsel later and met with Lindquist the
next day to give him a chance to withdraw his instruction. He told Lindquist and Farina that he
may have misunderstood what Lindquist asked — Lindquist said not to give declarants a good
deal, which could not be what he meant because it would be unethical to treat defendants
differently based on the identity of their defense attorney. Lindquist reportedly responded,
“Well, you don’t say that out loud; you use subtext.” Penner said he replied, “I know subtext,
but I want to make sure I know what you want me to communicate.” At that point, Penner said
that Lindquist knew that he wasn’t going to deliver the message, so Lindquist told him that there
are certain attorneys that we can’t trust to tell the truth about a conversation later and all
communications should be in writing.

Lindquist said he didn’t recall the first conversation, but recalled the second conversation
and thought it was odd. Lindquist said that Penner asked whether the negotiators should not be
giving deals to attorneys, to which Lindquist resPonded, “Of course not; you need to treat them
like any other clien .” Lindquist also said that he would not have given such an instruction to
Penner because Sheeran was responsible for the trial teams. Finally, Lindquist said that Penner
told PCPAO HR Manager Lisa Hilligoss that he got confused about how to deal with these
attorneys, went to Lindquist for clarification and received it.<sup>17</sup>

During her investigative interview, Hilligoss acknowledged to me that Penner came to
her concerned that Lindquist asked him to give the declarants “no deals.“ Importantly, regarding
Penner’s second conversation with Lindquist, she recalled that “Penner gave Lindquist the
opportunity to get off the hook and Lindquist took the opportunity.”

<sup>16</sup> _A Confederacy of Dunces_ is a novel by American John Kennedy Toole. The book’s title refers to an epigraph
from a Jonathan Swift essay, “When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the
dances are all in confederacy against him.”  
<sup>17</sup> Hilligoss stated in a declaration filed in support of Lindquist and F arina’s response to a WSBA complaint:

# See "no good deals" - Findings

I find that Lindquist gave Penner the “no good deals” instruction and later remanded it
based on the following: Penner reported his conversations with Lindquist to Hilligoss on the
same day; she recalled the second conversation as he described it — he gave Lindquist the chance
to withdraw his instruction and he did so; Lindquist asked Penner to speak to the trial team
negotiators because Krall had given a deal to a client of Clower, a declarant; and, by all accounts,
Lindquist was upset with the declarants, particularly Clower, and instructed his leadership that
they could not be trusted, which could justify, at least in his mind, treating them differently
during plea negotiations.

The instruction was also consistent with Lindquist’s political instincts. Penner reported
and a senior leader confirmed that Lindquist responded, when he was told he had to treat
Merrival the same after Merrival filed his Complaint: “I am a politician; you don’t understand;
you need to attack the person who makes the accusations.”

The only unit that reported receiving a “no good deals“ instruction was the SAU.<sup>18</sup>
Assistant Team Chief Heather DeMaine said that Homicide Division Chief Jared Ausserer
informally called the team DPAs into a hallway meeting. He had an affidavit with him and said
that criminal defense attorney Bryan Hershman had “called out” the office and said Koiman and
Lewis were dishonest. DeMaine recalled that Ausserer told them “give no deals to Hershman.”
DPA Sabrina Ahrens, who did not attend that meeting, said that DeMaine relayed the “no deals”
instruction to her shortly after it occurred. In contrast, Ausserer thought he said that the SAU
negotiators were not to give declarants any “special favors,” which meant that the declarants
were not to get special treatment with back door discussions, _e.g._, bypassing Ahrens and
speaking with Ausserer before plea negotiations were completed. Robnett likewise recalled that
DeMaine told her that Sheeran said “no special favors for these guys.“ Angelica Williams,
another DPA in SAU, recalled the meeting and said that Ausserer told them they should not feel
that they should have to give the declarants any “special deals,” _i.e._, they should treat all defense
attorneys alike. Williams said that Ausserer never said they should not give the declarants any
deals at all. She believed that Ausserer referred to Clower and Hershman specifically and meant
that the declarants like them, who had special relationships with the PCPAO, should not get any
special treatment.

Under these circumstances, I find on a more-probable-than—not basis that Ausserer told
SAU negotiators that they were to give “no special favors” or “no special deals” to the
declarants, meaning that they should be treated like all other defense attorneys. DeMaine heard
the instruction as “no deals,” which was reasonable in light of the rest of the message to the
DPAs, 126., don’t trust the declarants. This finding is supported by testimony of two other team
chiefs, Scott Peters and Michelle Hyer, who recalled that another team chief specifically asked
Sheeran if DPAs were not to give declarants the same deals as before. Sheeran reportedly
answered in the negative — treat them just as they had been treated before.<sup>19</sup>

<hr>

Late last year or earlier this year, Mr. Penner came to me and stated that he thought Mark
Lindquist had told him not to give a defendant on a case a good deal. Mr. Penner expressed
concerns that he was being told to do something unethical. Mr. Penner and I discussed options for
resolving his concerns. A day or two later, Mr. Penner came to me and stated that he had resolved
the issues. He stated that he had asked Mr. Lindquist if he had intended for him to purposely not
give a good deal or words to the effect that imply unethical behavior without explicitly stating so,
and Mr. Lindquist said that was not what he meant and confirmed that Mr. Penner should handle
the case appropriately.  
<sup>18</sup> Various DPAs recalled the instruction a little differently, which explains why it is sometimes referred to as “no
good deals,” “no deals” or “no special deals” or “no special treatment."  
<sup>19</sup> There is no conclusive evidence that any declarant or their clients received any discriminatory treatment during
plea negotiations. For example, Hershman reported that his long-term relationships with most DPAs protected
against any disparate treatment of his clients. In contrast, Harry Steinmetz said that DPA Frank Krall offered
limited County Jail time to a client of his; Team Chief Scott Peters took over the case and withdrew the offer; and,
after another attorney replaced Steinmetz on the case, Peters re-instated the offer. Steinmetz concluded that Peters
withdrew the deal because Steinmetz was a declarant, and re-instated it after his client replaced him on the case.
Krall said the offer changed because another DPA filed an additional criminal charge against the defendant. I
decided that further inquiry into the facts of the case were beyond the scope of this investigation.


# See Friendliness

Finally, numerous DPAs reported that PCPAO leadership admonished them for
conversing with the declarants in a friendly manner, despite their long-term, professional
relationships with the declarants.

 * Team Chief Sarah Richardson said that she saw Robnett at a TPCBA event, said “hello”
and spoke with Robnett for about 15 minutes because she had not seen her for awhile. Several
days later, Farina told Richardson that someone had seen her “gushing” with Robnett, who was
one of declarants that DPAs should not talk to. Farina said she had no recollection of
admonishing Richardson. I credit Richardson’s specific recollection over Farina’s lack of recall.
Further, as a Team Chief, she is not likely to fabricate an incident like this involving her
superior.
 * Dave Prather, a DPA in the Civil Division, said that Farina passed him talking with
criminal defense attorney Peter Kram near the County/City building. One-half hour later, Farina
knocked on his door and said that neither she nor Lindquist appreciated DPAs talking to
attorneys who filed declarations “against Mark.” Prather told her that he had no idea what she
was talking about, so Farina explained that a number of attorneys filed declarations in a case
against Lindquist and they didn’t want DPAs speaking to them. Prather responded that he was
only chatting with Kram because he had known him for 30 years. Farina said she had no
recollection of admonishing Prather. Again, I credit Prather’s Specific recollection over Farina’s
lack of recall because he has no reason to fabricate the encounter.
 * DeMaine said that she was on the telephone with Clower arguing about a bail amount,
when Sheeran appeared in her doorway and told her to come into Team Chief Sven Nelson’s
office. According to DeMaine, Sheeran laid into her: “Do you know who is on the list of 33
attorneys who filed affidavits?“ When DeMaine told him that she didn’t know who was on the
list other than Hershman, Sheeran said: “We are a family and we need to have each other’s back.
When one of us is called a liar, then all of us are called a liar.” Sheeran went on to admonish
DeMaine not to be so friendly with Clower and the other declarants. Nelson recalled that
Sheeran saw DeMaine on the phone with Clower, getting him some information that he could
have gotten himself the next day. Nelson said that Sheeran told DeMaine, “We are not telling
you not to speak to people (act professionally), but you don’t need to do special favors for people
in active litigation with the office.”
 * Lindquist’s assistant, Kelly Kelstrup, said that she went to a retirement party for DPA
Carl Hultman and spoke to many people, including some defense attorneys. Later, Lindquist
told her that she should be careful when she is speaking to defense counsel at parties because
they may lie about their conversation.
 * DPA Ray O’Dell reported that his Team Chief, Michelle Hyer, came into his office and
said that Sheeran told her “attorneys” were being nice to the people “on the list.” O’Dell
responded, “This is high school bullshit,” to which Hyer said, “I just don’t want you in trouble in
Mark’s office.” Hyer said she relayed the conversation to Lindquist. Later, O’Dell said he got a
visit from Penner, who told him: “Mark heard that you called him immature; he wanted me to
communicate to you that if you want to be in leadership, this is not the way to ac .” O’Dell said
he replied: “Are you kidding me, why are we having this talk.“ Penner answered: “I am doing
what I was asked to do; is there anything that you want me to say to Mark?“ Penner confirmed
the gist of the facts reported by O’Dell (and Hyer), so I find them credible.

# See C. Public Records Act Allegations

_**Allegation**_: Both the Merrival and Penner Complaints allege violations of the Public
Records Act, RCW 42.56 et seq. The Merrival Complaint alleged that the PCPAO discourages
email and other forms of electronic communication, permits text communications on private
devices but does not retain them, and creates public records for the purpose of prejudicing the
subject of the communication. The Penner Complaint further alleged that Lindquist schedules
meetings on his calendar by stating “Meeting” only to avoid public disclosure of the meeting
agenda. Both Complaints cite examples of these more general allegations.

_**Summary of the Findings**_: The PCPAO discourages its staff from sending emails when
the purpose of the communication is “better accomplished” by using the telephone or walking
down the hall; Lindquist created an email regarding “affidavits of prejudice“ against Superior
Court Judge Stephanie Arend for the purpose of retaliating against her for her treatment of
former Homicide Chief Kevin McCann at trial; 2“ Lindquist put “Meeting” on the office calendar
to avoid disclosure of the meeting agenda, cOpies of which are collected after the meeting; and,
Lindquist told Penner he wasn’t a “team player” because Penner would not play along with
Lindquist’s preference to have a cell phone conversation on a “PRA-proof” basis, i. a. , private
cell phone to private cell phone.

_**Summary of the Evidence**_: The evidence pertaining to each of the allegations follows.

**i. The PCPAO’s Policy.** By way of background, on April 26, 2013, Farina
emailed PCPAO employees about the status of the Nissan v. Pierce County public records act
case, which sought Lindquist’s private cell phone records, and advised: “In the interest of
employee privacy and to avert litigation, please be reminded that while it is sometimes
unavoidable in serving the public, the use of personal phones for county business is
discouraged.” According to Robnett and others, Lindquist regularly used his personal cell
phone for County business. The Nissan case made clear the risks of such use, so the PCPAO
clarified the policy regarding the use of personal cell phones for County business to protect
personal cell phone records and to “avert litigation,” like the _Nissan_ case.

Later that year, on November 25, 2013, the PCPAO revised its “E—Mail, Internet Use, and
Electronic Records Policy.” The office adopted the County policy with the following additions:
“Email should not be used where the purpose would be better accomplished with a face-to-face
conversation or phone call;” and, office-wide and division-wide emails, including “reply all,”
were restricted to designated office managers.” According to Farina, the policy was consistent
with Lindquist’s philosophy to communicate, and to communicate in person, if possible. She
added that policy was also intended to lighten the workload of PRA officers — more emails
mean more documents to produce, which is taxing on public resources.

_**2. Impact of the Policy.**_ Every witness confirmed that they have been told
repeatedly not to put anything into writing when you can call on a telephone or walk down the
hall and talk in person. The office has also advised DPAs to be cognizant that emails are public
records; as one member of leadership said, “You need to be thinking of public records requests
when you write emails — what to write and how to write it.” A number of witnesses, including
members of leadership, said that they were told to use the “front page test” (my words) — don’t
put anything in writing that they don’t want to see on the front page of the Tacoma News
Tribune (“TNT”). DPAs reported being admonished for any failure to follow the policy and
these instructions.

2” “Any party to or any attorney appearing in any action or proceeding in a superior court, may establish such _
prejudice by motion, supported by affidavit that the judge before whom the action is pending is prejudiced against
such party or attorney, so that such party or attorney cannot, or believes that he or she cannot, have a fair and
impartial trial before such judge. . . ."" RCW 4.12.0500).

2‘ Consistent with the revised policy, Farina’s email transmitting the policy to employees stated, “If you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call or stop by my office.”

Witnesses also continued that Lindquist has “Meeting” placed on attendees’ calendars
without identifying the agenda. Lindquist’s assistant recalled that she was instructed to adopt
the procedure and assumed, like others, that the purpose was to limit the amount of information
available regarding the meeting in the event of a PRA request. The assistant’s understanding is
continued by the office’s practice of passing out agendas at leadership meetings and asking
attendees not to take them when they leave. In addition, one former Team Chief said that he
would routinely make summaries of the Team Chief meetings and would send them by email to
the DPAs in his unit, including summaries of half-yearly statistical information. He said that
Robnett made clear to him that Lindquist did not want the information in writing and it should
be conveyed orally instead. I find on the basis of this evidence that these practices were
intended to limit the information disclosed in response to a PRA request.

Merrival specifically alleged that, as example of the policy, DPAs were instructed not to
write down the names of “Brady officers” and the PCPOA maintained no “Brady list.” He
further claimed that his supervisor directed him not to document “Brady” issues in emails. As
noted, the PCPAO has not created a “Brady list" of officers for which they maintain PIE
information at the behest of law enforcement agencies, officers and guilds; such a list, without
more, could have a potential negative impact on the reputation of the officers. This practice is a
matter of PIE policy, not the office’s email policy. Regarding the alleged instruction not to
document “Brady” issues in email, his supervisor, Team Chief Maureen Goodman, recalled that
Merrival had concerns about a Fife officer based on video footage in the criminal file. Goodman
recalled telling Merrlval not to contact the officer because, if the footage indicated wrongdoing,
then the officer had certain rights.22 Goodman said that she looked at the video, decided it was
problematic for the officer, discussed the matter with Penner and Sheeran, and later cooperated
with the detective assigned to the department’s IA investigation. Ultimately, the PCPAO
dismissed the case and Fife fired the officer. According to Goodman, she responded to
Merrival’s concerns, she followed proper procedures, the matter was investigated and eventually
it became public. I find that the PCPAO’s response to these specific events was motivated by a

legitimate effort to balance the rights of the officer and the office’s constitutional obligations,
and not an effort to evade the PRA.

Penner alleged in his Complaint that in early 2015 Lindquist called Penner, from private
phone to private phone, about the reversal of the conviction in State v. Dorcas Allen. Lindquist
asked Penner if he had read the Seattle Times article about the case and, when Penner said, “no,”
Lindquist asked him to read it and call him back. When Penner returned the call, Lindquist
admonished Penner for calling his personal cell phone from Penner’s work phone and told
Penner to call back using Penner’s personal cell phone.23 The next day Lindquist told Penner
that he did not understand the Court of Appeals decision in the Nissan litigation and again
admonished him, this time for not being a team player for putting Lindquist’s cell phone records
at risk of disclosure.

<hr>

22 Goodman does not recall that she told Merrival, in particular, not to document the situation in an email. However,
the alleged direction would be consistent with the PCPAO’s policy regarding emails described above.

23 By calling Lindquist‘s personal cell phone from his work phone, Penner put Lindquist’s private cellphone
number in his work phone call logs, which could be subject to a PRA request.


Penner reiterated and confirmed these events in his interview. Lindquist responded that
he was reaching out to Penner on a personal level as a friend to provide him with support. He

said if Penner intended to discuss work, Penner should have returned the call to Lindquist’s work
cell phone. Lindquist did not deny admonishing Penner for the return call.

I credit Penner’s version of the conversation. if Lindquist was calling Penner as a friend,
Lindquist would not have told Penner to read the newspaper article and call him back; the details
of the article would be irrelevant to any expression of sympathy or understanding. The details
would only be important if Lindquist wanted to fashion a public statement in response to the
decision, or discuss the impact of the decision on the case and/or the office, which are work-
related conversations. Under these circumstances, I find that Lindquist told Penner he wasn’t a

team player because Penner would not play along with Lindquist’s preference to have the
conversation on a PRA-proof basis.

3. Prejudicial Public Records. Finally, the Merrival Complaint alleged that
Lindquist prepared and sent an e—mail because he thought it would hurt the political campaign of
a judicial candidate if it was produced in resPonse to a public disclosure request. Lindquist sent
the email referred to in the Complaint, dated January 20, 2011, to members of leadership
regarding “affidavits of prejudice.” Exhibit 2. Lindquist wrote, “Judge Arend repeatedly treated
two of our outstanding DPAs, Kevin McCann and Steve Penner, disreSpectfully and
unprofessionally.” He said that members of the victims“ families complained about the treatment

and advised DPAs to consider filing an affidavit of prejudice against Judge Arend “on our more
serious cases.”

According to Penner, he and former Homicide Chief Kevin McCann prosecuted a case in
November 2010 involving a defendant who assisted the accused murderer of the Lakewood
police officers. Penner said that Lindquist assigned McCann to the trial and directed him to do
any public appearances associated with it because McCann was campaigning for a judicial
position at the time.24 Pierce County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Arend presided over the
trial and, according to Penner, seemed to treat McCann poorly for reasons that were unclear to
them. Judge Arend treated Penner just fine, so he and McCann decided that Penner would argue
important motions during the trial. Penner said that Lindquist spoke about running someone
against Judge Arend, but Penner had no knowledge regarding the origin of the email.

Lindquist said that he had high respect for Judge Arend as a person and judge and wrote
the email after the case was resolved due to concerns expressed by the family. He recalled that
Judge Arend was not running for election in 2011 (judges run in presidential years, which was
2012) and said that he stayed out of her next race because her opponent was on the TPCBA
magazine’s editorial board. Lindquist‘s Chief of Staff, Dawn Farina, labeled the allegation
“ridiculous;” she said Lindquist met with Judge Arend and her political consultant about
Lindquist’s concerns afterwards and “everything worked out.”

<hr>

2“ Penner also emphasized that McCann was well-qualified to handle the case and was more experienced than
Penner.

Lindquist’s former Chief Criminal Deputy Mary Robnett had a completely different
recollection. She said that Lindquist was unhappy with Judge Arend and worked on several
drafts of an email stating that Judge Arend had done some things that were prejudicial to the
office and McCann. She confirmed that Lindquist assigned McCann to the case because he was
running for office at the time and would get free publicity hom the trial. And, Robnett recalled
that Judge Arend was critical of McCann, so Lindquist wrote the email to make her sorry for

treating McCann that way. Lindquist told Robnett that it will look really bad when the TNT
asked for the email during the next election cycle.

I find that the allegation in the Merrival Complaint is credible, 13.6., Lindquist drafted the
“affidavits of prejudice” email for the purpose of retaliating against Judge Arend for her
treatment of McCann. First, many witnesses confirmed that Lindquist supported McCann’s
judicial aspirations in a variety of ways, some of which are described more fully below.
Witnesses also said that Lindquist saw himself as a judge—maker; one former Superior Court
judge said that Lindquist once stated, “I elect judges, the people don"t.“25 Most importantly,
Robnett was one of Lindquist’s most trusted deputies at the time and was in a position to share
with Lindquist his most intimate confidences. Her recollection is consistent with Penner’s and,
in my opinion, she has more to lose than gain from revealing those confidences.

D. Violation of State and Federal Labor Relations Acts

Both the Merrival and the Penner Complaints allege that Lindquist engages in various
activities that interfere with the operation of the Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney’s
Association (“Guild”), which is the DPA’s collective bargaining representative.

1. The Guild First Vice President Election.

Allegation: Both Complaints alleged that Jim Schacht decided to run for the Guild’s First
Vice President position in 2014 and afterwards DPA Erica Nohavec, a supporter of Lindquist’s,
decided to run against him.26 Division Chief Tim Lewis allegedly instructed junior DPAs in the

Misdemeanor Division to vote for Nohavec, but Lindquist refused to take any action because it
was a “Guild issue.”

Summa_ry of the Factual Findings: Team Chief Erica Nohavec decided to run for the
Guild position before DPA Jim Schacht and Lindquist did not encourage her to do so, at least in

an effort to defeat him; Lindquist explicitly and implicitly communicated to leadership that they
should encourage DPAs to vote for Nohavec instead of Schacht in the election; Misdemeanor
Division Chief Tim Lewis questioned DPA Annie Guttierez about what went on at a Guild
meeting where the candidates spoke and how specific DPAs were going to vote; Guttierez, a
Guild officer, reported Lewis” conduct to the Guild; Lindquist passed Guttierez over for
promotion because she reported Lewis, one of his Division Chiefs, to the Guild; Lindquist has
promoted the last four Guild Presidents to leadership positions in his administration.

<hr>

25 Judge Arend did not return my two telephone calls to her courtroom.
2“ Merrival alleged that Lindquist encouraged her to oppose Schacht.

Summgy of the Evidence: Lindquist said that Nohavec was already in the race when he
heard about it and he did not encourage her to run for the position. Team Chief Scott Peters said

that he was the incumbent First Vice President of the Guild at that the time, but had decided to
give up the position to run for President and replace Jared Ausserer when he was promoted out
of the bargaining unit. Peters said that Nohavec was the first person who contacted him about

the position, followed by Schacht a few days later. I find on the basis of this evidence that

Nohavec decided to run before Schacht and Lindquist did not encourage her to do so, at least in
an effort to defeat him.”

During the election campaign, Lindquist said he heard that the race had become mildly
divisive and some people weren’t going to vote. So, he spoke with Lewis and told him that
Misdemeanor DPAs should vote, and for anyone they wanted. Penner diSputed Lindquist’s
version of events; he said that Lindquist told leadership they should tell the DPAs to vete for
Nohavec over Schacht. Lewis said that Lindquist wanted to know from him whether the
Misdemeanor DPAs were voting in the election. Lewis knew that Nohavec was a good friend of
Lindquist's and he was fond of her work, so Lewis understood that Lindquist wanted the junior
DPAs to support Nohavec. I find that Lindquist explicitly and irnplicitly communicated to

leadership that they should encourage DPAs to vote for Nohavec instead of Schacht in the Guild
election.

Lewis said he asked at least one DPA, Armie Guttierez, if the Misdemeanor Division
DPAs were voting and if Nohavec had their support. He said that Guttierez was uncomfortable
with the question and told him that she had an obligation to tell the Guild’s Executive Board,

which Lewis said he understood. He recalled that Guttierez was crying and he told her it was
going to be OK.

Guttierez’ version of the situation wasn’t nearly so benign. She recalled that the First VP
was the only contested position at the time and the election was quite contentious. Lewis, her
Division Chief, questioned her about what happened at the Guild meeting where the candidates
made their pitches to the membership. He tried to confirm negative statements about Nohavec
made by DPA John Neeb and asked if DPAs in Misdemeanor “know how they should be voting
[:1 a, for Nohavec].” He also asked Guttierez how specific DPAs were going to vote, which gave
her the impression that he was tallying votes. Guttierez responded that she was Secretary of the
Guild and was not comfortable answering his questions. She also believed that, as a member of
the Guild’s Executive Board, she had to do something, so she reported Lewis" conduct to DPA
Lisa Wagner (a Guild officer), who promised to keep her identity confidential.

<hr>

27" Nohavec is on leave of absence bout the office so I was unable to speak to her about the Guild election and could
not confirm Lindquist’s claim that he did not encourage Nohavec to run for the position.


Subsequently, on two different occasions, Lewis questioned Guttierez to determine who
had reported him to Wagner. During this process, Lewis offered Guttierez the opportunity to try
a four-person homicide case, which shocked Guttierez because the prospect of trying a homicide
case had never been discussed with her in her performance evaluations or otherwise.28 Finally,
Lewis again questioned her about whether she had reported him saying, “There are questions on
the 9th fioor [where the senior leadership offices are located]; people are questioning your
judgment. Annie, did this come from you?” When she finally broke down and told Lewis,
“yes,” he said, “I understand; I will go to 9 and fix this.“ He came back a few minutes later and

said, “Annie, everything is going to be fine. You are going to get the next County Attorney II,”
which would be a promotion for her.

Unfortunately for Guttierez, Lewis could not deliver on his promise because Guttierez
was passed over for promotion around the same time period as the Guild vote. Lindquist said
that when Guttierez’ promotion was presented to him, no one suggested that her complaint was
a reason for her not being recommended for promotion. Farina said that Guttierez was passed
over because others were ahead of her, and Guttierez had “checked out” and was not acting as a
mentor to less senior DPAs in the Misdemeanor Division. Since then, according to Farina,
Guttierez was promoted because she responded appropriately by improving.

I don’t find these explanations credible. Team Chief Michelle Hyer, Guttierez’ mentor,
said that Lindquist spoke to her briefly about Guttierez to find out whether Guttierez was a
“team player” after Guttierez questioned whether Lewis overstepped his boundaries.
Consequently, Hyer suggested to Guttierez that she apologize to Lindquist and Farina out of
concern for her “career-wise.” Guttierez' supervisor, Jennifer Sievers, said that Lewis told her
leadership didn’t know if Guttierez could get promoted because they were not able to trust her.
And, as noted, Lewis told Guttierez that “the 9th floor” leadership was questioning her
judgment. On the basis of this evidence, I find that Lindquist passed Guttierez over for
promotion because she reported Lewis, one of Lindquist’s Division Chiefs, to the Guild.

Another phenomenon related to the Guild is worth mentioning here. That is, the last four
Guild Presidents have all been promoted to leadership positions and replaced by the then sitting
First Vice President: Robnett was the Guild President when she was the Team Chief of SAU,
and then left the position and the bargaining unit after Lindquist promoted her to Chief Criminal
Deputy; John Sheeran, the Guild First Vice President at the time, took over as Guild President
until Lindquist promoted Sheeran to Felony Division Chief; Jared Ausserer followed Sheeran as
Guild President until Lindquist promoted him to Homicide Division Chief; and, Scott Peters, the
current Guild President, followed Sheeran. Lindquist appointed Peters to the position of Team
Chief of Team III when he assumed the role of Guild President.

<hr>

23 Assignment of a multi—person homicide case is a vote of confidence in the PCPAO and would be viewed
favorably for promotion purposes.

Lindquist explained this pattern by observing that leadership qualities are the same
wherever they manifest themselves, so it makes sense for Guild Presidents to assume leadership
positions in the office. Farina said that she understood the perception that Guild Presidents have
been selected for leadership. Her explanation was similar to Lindquist’s — these DPAs were
selected as Guild President because they stood out as good lawyers and colleagues, which is a
perfect match for leadership positions in the office. Whether the phenomenon is simply an
effective leadership selection tool, or a method of influencing the Guild and co-opting its leaders,
it might explain the interest of N ohavec and other Lindquist supporters in seeking the Guild’s
First Vice President position.

2. Monitoring Guild Activities.

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint fin'ther alleges that “Lindquist monitors all Guild

Summgy of the Factual Findings: Lindquist closely monitored the activities of the
Guild, particularly as they pertained to matters important to him, such as the amicus brief in

Dalsing; and, Lindquist rewarded and retaliated against DPAs’ because of their union activities.

Summm of the Evidence: Lindquist said that he doesn’t ask what goes on in Guild
meetings, but “the information filters up to me.” One senior leader said he has been in

leadership meetings and what happened in Guild meetings was discussed, so the information got
back to Lindquist. Sunni Ko, a former Team Chief, said that she and others reported to Lindquist
what happened at Guild meetings, which she described as “the normal protocol.“ She said that
Lindquist expected her to report back and wanted to control the Guild. Robnett said that it is
“absolutely true” that Lindquist was interested in the Guild meetings. He asked DPAs what
happened at meetings (ag. , who said what; how people voted; whether the Guild was going to
endorse a particular candidate) and people would go by his office to tell him.

For example, Robnett recalled that Lindquist was very interested when McCann, who
Lindquist supported, was running for judge. Lindquist wanted to know about the Guild
discussion and who said what because the Guild’s endorsement and financial support was
important to McCann. Merrival said that early in Lindquist’s tenure Lindquist introduced a new
performance evaluation tool, which the Guild discussed. When DPAs expressed concern that it
might be used to get rid of employees, Merrival suggested that they should give it a try. Merrival
said that after that meeting Lindquist thanked him for standing up for him. Lindquist said he had
others there that could have done the same thing and, “I don’t know why they didn’t.”

DPA Brian Leech had a similar but morelnegative experience. During a Guild meeting
to decide if the Guild was going to sign an amicus brief in the Dalsr'ng case, Leech said he
commented that the brief was not accurate and the Guild needed more time to consider it. He
said that DPA Jason Ruyf, a Lindquist supporter, became upset with Leech and asked in a raised
voice, “What good can become of this [delay]?” Other witnesses confirmed this exchange. DPA

Annie Guttierez said that shortly after the meeting she saw Lindquist in Ruyf’ s office. First
thing the following Monday, Penner said that Lindquist called him into his office and asked,
“What is wrong with Brian Leech,“ saying that Leech argued against the Dalsing amicus brief at
the Guild meeting. Lindquist told Penner, “Talk to Dawn about moving him back to Remann
Hall.”29 Penner said he never did talk with Farina; instead, he spoke with Sheeran a few days

later, who said they were not going to move Leech.

I find that Lindquist closely monitored the activities of the Guild, particularly as they
pertained to matters important to him, such as the proposed performance evaluation tool, judicial
endorsements, and the amicus brief in Dalsr'ng. Furthermore, as the foregoing examples indicate,
the union activities of DPAs are sometimes rewarded by Lindquist (Mcrrival and Ruyf), and at
other times they lead to retribution by him (Guttierez and Leech).

3. Elimination of Union Position.

Allegation: Penner’s Complaint alleges that in 2013, former DPA Grant Blinn decided to

seek the Lakewood Municipal Court Judge position. To support his candidacy, Lindquist moved
Blinn from his Misdemeanor Division Chief position to leader of the homicide trial team,
reclassified the position to a Division Chief to protect Blinn“ s salary, and renamed the position
“Homicide Chief.“ Penner claimed that Lindquist believed that the title of Homicide Chief

would help Blinn’s judicial application. Penner alleged that Lindquist made the change
unilaterally and without notice to the Guild, despite the fact that it eliminated a bargaining unit

position.

Summm of the Factual Findings: Lindquist laterally transferred Blinn from his position
as Misdemeanor Division Chief to Homicide Division Chief; Lindquist replaced Blinn with

Lewis and upgraded Lewis“ classification to Division Chief, thereby removing his position from
the Guild bargaining unit; the PCPAO upgraded Lewis" position unilaterally and without notice
to the Guild; the evidence suggests that Lindquist’s motive in transferring Blinn was to keep him
at the PCPAO, but the Homicide Chief position has been a stepping stone to a judgeship, which

Blinn eventually took advantage of.

Summa_ry of the Evidence: According to Lisa Hilligoss, the PCPAO’s Human Resources
Manager, Blinn retained his position and salary as a Division Chief when he moved to the
homicide position; it was a straight lateral transfer. Instead, the office reclassified Tim Lewis”

County Attorney 3 position when he replaced Blinn as Misdemeanor Division Chief. Farina
stated in an email to Hilligoss, dated September 24, 2013:

Please draft a letter to Human Resources asking that Tim Lewis (CA3 position) be
reclassified to Senior Supervising Deputy Position (Misdemeanor Division
Chief). Tim is being reassigned to our Misdemeanor Division as its Chief. Please
state in the letter that Tim will supervise a division that files more than 10,000
case (sic) per year, with a staff of more than 29. Double check on the number of
staff in the misdemeanor division. Please also state that we will absorb the costs
in our 2013/2014 budget. Cindy can give you the cost of the reclass.
Grant will be keeping his position and moving to the Homicide Team where he
will be the lead attorney overseeing the homicide unit.

<hr>

29 Remann Hall houses the Juvenile Division and is reputedly where Lindquist transfers DPAs who are considered
“malcontents.” See, Section V., infra.


Hilligoss admitted that the move was made unilaterally by the office, without notice to the Guild,
with the effect of eliminating a position in the bargaining unit, the County Attorney 3 position
formerly occupied by Lewis.

Regarding Lindquist’s motive for moving Blinn, Sheeran, Blinn’s brother-in—law, said, “I
know this one pretty well — it was not done to promote Blinn’s judgeship; Mark wanted him to
stay and gave him the position to encourage him to stay.” Sheeran said that Blinn took the
position because it was interesting and he could try any homicide case in the office, but
eventually Blinn “jumped” to the judiciary.30 Lindquist and Farina both confirmed that they
made the move to encourage Blinn to stay with the PCPAO.

That said, the movement from Homicide Chief to the judiciary is a phenomenon similar
to the movement from Guild President to PCPAO leadership described above. Kevin McCann
and Jerry Costello, who preceded Blinn, both moved from the Homicide Chief position to
judgeships in Lakewood Municipal Court and Pierce County Superior Court respectively.31
Undoubtedly, it was this history that caused many witnesses to speculate that Lindquist moved
Blinn into the position to be next in line.

E. Violation of Family Leave Act

Allegation: The Penner Complaint alleged that Lindquist directed then Criminal Deputy
Phil Sorenson to contact DPA Jared Ausserer, then SAU Team Chief, to return to the office from
FMLA leave to re-file charges against Dalsing.

Summary of the Factual Findings: The allegation is true.

Summary of the Evidence: Farina continued that Ausserer’s leave began on December
21, 2013. She said he came into the office about once a week during his leave to check on his
cases until his leave ended on March 15, 2014. Farina further stated that the office did not
instruct Ausserer to return to the office before his leave ended; he made the final charging
decision after he came back.

<hr>

3” I did not interview Blinn because I was advised that he preferred not to participate, but would cooperate fully and
honestly, if asked. I chose to honor his preference.
31 The position was not classified as a Division Chief when McCann and Costello occupied it.


Ausserer said that he told Lindquist that he planned to take a 3-month leave of absence
and would return to the office one or two times a week to keep up with his cases. As it turned
out, Ausserer said that he returned to the office 17 times to handle multiple hearings on various
cases.

In early February, Ausserer said that former Chief Criminal Deputy Phil Sorenson called
him and said he had to come into the office to charge Dalsing. Ausserer asked, “Did you get any
new information? I am not going to come in and charge her unless you have something new; I’m
not going to do it.” Sorenson responded that it was not him that was asking, but Farina, who
wanted him to come in the next day. Ausserer said that he was planning to come in on Friday
anyway, so he went in and checked his emails, spoke with the detectives on the Dalsing case and
determined there was no new information. So, Ausserer told Sorenson and Sheeran that there
was no basis to charge her.

Ausserer said that he returned to the office from leave as scheduled on March 17, 2014.
After he returned, DPA Jim Richmond provided him with new information on Dalsing (see
declaration of probable cause), which Ausserer had the detectives follow up on. Ausserer said he
determined that the new information supported a charge and filed new charges in late March.32

In short, while on leave, Ausserer voluntarily returned to the office a couple of times a
week to work on his cases. Once, in early February, he returned at Sorenson’s and Farina’s
direction on a day he was planning to visit the office anyway. He refused to re—file charges on

Dalsing at that time, as Farina requested. He re-iiled them when he returned to work in mid-
March after his leave.

F. Violation of State and Federal Employment Laws

Both the Merrival and Penner Complaints contain numerous allegations of employment
law violations. I will review those in the Merrival Complaint first, followed by the Penner
Complaint.

1. Lack of Diversity.

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that the PCPAO does not have any person
of color or of minority status in the administration; minorities are not well represented among
DPAs; and, the office does not reflect the diversity of the community.

Summary of the Factual Findings: No person of color holds a leadership position in the
PCPAO; minorities have historically not been well-represented among DPAs; however, as a
result of efforts of the office generally and the Diversity Committee in particular, the minority

3'2 I do not make a finding here regarding who made the decision to file new charges against Dalsing. One DPA
reported that Ausserer told him at the WAPA conference in June 2015, when the subject of the whistleblower
complaints came up: "I don't make the decisions; Dawn doesn't make the decisions; Mark makes them."

pepulation of DPAs in the office is improving, and the population in the Misdemeanor Division
in particular is on par with the local community.

Summgy of the Evidence: Regarding the issue of minorities in leadership, Hilligoss said
that DPA James Curtis, who is African American, is Chair of the PCPAO’s Diversity
Committee. In that capacity, she said that he attends the Team Chief meetings and the two
leadership team meetings (a full day in the spring; 2%: days in the fall). While Curtis
acknowledged his role as Chair of the Diversity Committee, he agreed (“absolutely true") that
the office has no minorities in leadership positions.

Hilligoss also provided minority demographics for the PCPAO (Misdemeanor DPAs;
DPAs Overall; Office Overall) as of October 2013, compared to various populations: UW and
Seattle University Law Schools; Pierce County; State of Washington. Exhibit 3. She updated

and expanded the analysis on August 20, 2015 to include various minority populations. Exhibit
4. Her take on the data was:

[A] 1though our percentage of minorities for the entire office is low, our
percentage of minority population in the Misdemeanor Division is on par at
32%. This is important to note as all new staff hired at the Prosecutor’s Office
start in the Misdemeanor Division. This shows that although historically the
office might not have done a great job of ensuring a diverse work group, this is
not true any longer. Additionally, over time this diverse group will expand to
other areas of the office as employees promote out of the Misdemeanor Division.

Curtis said that he recruits minorities in a variety of ways. He attends the Minority Job
Fair, recruiting and urging the hiring of minorities as interns; he has brought students of color to
the office as a part of the Think Together program; and, he makes presentations at all local high
schools. He said that there were only five African Americans in the office, for example, but he
believes that the work of the Committee has been effective.

G. Hostile Workplace

l. Culturally Insensitive Remarks.

Allegation: Merrival alleged that Lindquist made the following culturally insensitive
remarks.

Summgy of the Factual Findings: The evidence does not support the allegation.

Summa_ry of the Evidence: The evidence of each alleged remark is summarized below.

a. “Are you going to the casino?” Merrival (a tribal member)
alleged that Lindquist asked him this when they pass outside the courthouse. Lindquist agreed
and said he asked Merrival about eating at the Emerald Queen casino because the two of them
used to have lunch at the casino on a semi-regular basis. A number of other wimesses thought
the allegation was odd because Lindquist, Merrival and others often went to the casino for lunch.

b. “You should get rid of these payments to tribal members
because they just use them to buy guns. 7" Merrival alleged that Lindquist made the statement
to him when they were eating at the casino. Lindquist said that he and Merrival had a discussion
about how the Puyallup and Tulalip tribes use casino money differently, but he did not say they
used the money to buy guns. 1 cannot determine whose recollection 1s accurate because no other
persons participated 1n the conversation.

c. “Tribal loyalty.” Merrival alleged that Lindquist refered to “tribal
loyalty“ in his annual Speech to the office, ten, “people in the office need to stick together, those
who do will succeed.“ Lindquist said that Peggy Noonan33 ends one of her books, “Be good to
your tribe,” a concept he finds useful and has used. Many witnesses confirmed that Lindquist
relies on various business leadership books to guide his management of the office.

2. Use of “N” Word in Closing Argument.

Allegation: This allegation refers to Farina’s closing argument in State v. Walker. <mark>The
Washington Supreme Court overturned the defendant's conviction, in part, because Farina used a
PowerPoint slide in her closing that superimposed over the defendant’s picture a quotation from
the defendant that included the “N” word. The Court concluded that the use of the word
wrongfully introduced race when there was no indication of a racial motive in the murder.</mark>

Summary of the Factual Findings: Farina did use the “N“ word in her closing argument
in the Walker case, which was related to the evidence in the case and is not indicative of a hostile
work enviromnent in the PCPAO.

Summaary of the Evidence: Lindquist said that he has great respect for Farina as an
attorney and does not believe that she intended to insert race into the case inappropriately.
However, whether he agreed or disagreed with the Court, he said the PCPAO must play by the
rules set down by the Washington Supreme Court. DPA Jim Schacht, regarded by most
witnesses as a very good trial lawyer, said that the use of the word was related to the specific
arguments made in that case, so he did not consider it to be evidence of a hostile work
environment in the office. He said that, as the appellate courts have issued opinions regarding
the use of PowerPoint in closing arguments, the Appeals Division Chief, Kit Proctor, has sent out
emails admonishing DPAs about the use of PowerPoint and urging them to read the cases.34

33 Peggy Noonan is an American author of several books on politics, religion, and culture, and a weekly columnist
for The Wall Street Journal.

3“ DPA Annie Guttierez recalled that DPAs in the Misdemeanor Division have received training on the use of
PowerPoint in closing arguments.

3. Assigning DPA James Curtis to Prosecute a Predominately African
American Caseload.

Allegation: Merrival said that he believes Curtis, an African American DPA, has been
pigeon-holed because of his race.

Summw of the Factual Findings: Curtis is on the Gang Team at his own request
because he wants to litigate Class A felonies and violent crimes and to help the Hilltop

community where he lives. The PCPAO did not assign him to prosecute gangs because of his
race.

Summgy of the Evidence: Curtis works on the Gang Team prosecuting crimes
committed by gangs, including Black gangs in the Hilltop area of Tacoma. He said that the
allegation offended him and it was wrong to suggest that he targeted defendants based on race.
Curtis recalled that he worked on his first gang case in the drug unit with Penner that involved a
homicide victim Curtis knew. After they tried the case and secured a conviction, Curtis asked
Lindquist if he could transfer to the gang unit because he grew up in the Hilltop community and
wanted to prosecute Class A felonies and serious violent crimes. Curtis said that gangs affect his
community and he is passionate about serving persons from there.

Greg Greer, the Asst. Criminal Division Chief and team leader of the Gang Team, said
that the allegation did not make sense to him; he did not agree that a juror will decide against a
African American defendant because the prosecutor is African American. Greer stated that he
has tremendous respect for Curtis, who has a unique perspective because he grew up on the

Hilltop. According to Greer, Curtis does a lot of work in African American community and his
effort to give back is unparalleled.

4. Disparate Treatment of Hispanic DPA.

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that leadership forced out a Hispanic DPA
for failing to prosecute cases aggressively, yet did not similarly target a Caucasian DPA who
lacked aggressiveness, but displayed a Lindquist campaign poster in his office.35

Summgy of the Factual Findings: Lindquist engaged in active performance management
of a Hispanic DPA who, by all accounts, had serious performance issues; the Caucasian DPA

also had performance issues, but Lindquist did not take personnel action against him because he
was retiring soon. Race does not appear to be a factor in these cases.

Lindquist said that he supervised the Hispanic DPA when he was the Team Chief of the
Drug Team. He reported to leadership that the DPA was falling short of expectations in many
ways and the DPA resigned. Lindquist could not recall if the DPA resigned in lieu of
termination. Kevin Benton, Chief of the Juvenile Division, opined that the Hispanic DPA did
not perform well as a prosecutor. In contrast, Benton said that the Caucasian DPA had the
ability but lost interest over time and is now retired. Lindquist said that Merrival and others
complained about the Caucasian DPA’s work, but no one “went down that road very far,” so the
situation never approached termination. Lindquist also offered that he was unaware that the
Caucasian DPA was a supporter in any of his campaigns. Finally, another DPA stated that the
Caucasian DPA was ineffective and “a lot of people clean up his messes,” but people overlooked
his shortcomings because he was getting ready to retire.

<hr>

35 It is unclear whether the allegation is disparate treatment because of race or political activity.



‘5. Older DPAs Don’t Have a Future in the Office.

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that Lindquist made statements to the effect
that he keeps older DPAs around to cultivate the careers of younger ones.

Summa_ry of the Factual Findings: Lindquist told a long-term prosecutor, “We are here to
cultivate the careers of younger attorneys. I expect you to assist.” The remark was made in the
context of the transfers of the long-term DPA to try Class B/C felonies, and the transfer of a
relatively inexperienced DPA, who was Lindquist’s campaign manager, to try Class A felonies,

an assignment she sought.

Summm of the Evidence: According to DPA Kawyne Lund, Lindquist made a similar
statement to her. Land is a County Attorney 4 who has been with the PCPAO since 1980. In
2012, she was transferred against her wishes to the Appeals unit. Lund said she wanted to get
back to a trial unit from the beginning of the assignment and finally got the word from Penner in
July 2014 that she was moving to Team 1 to prosecute Class B/ C felonies. Initially, she was
ecstatic with the transfer because she assumed that there was no opportunity to try Class A
felonies, but learned later that day that DPA Jim Schacht was being transferred to Appeals and
Bryce Nelson was replacing Schacht on Class A felonies. She expressed her displeasure to

Penner, who said, “We have to give these young attorneys a chance.” Lund said she responded,
“Why can’t he wait like the rest of us did?”

First thing the following Monday, Lund said that Lindquist called her into his office and
told her, in effect, he was not happy that she was not satisfied with her transfer. When Lund
asked why Nelson, a much less experienced DPA, wasn’t assigned to prosecute Class B/ C
felonies to get more trial experience, Lindquist said (three times), “We are here to cultivate the
careers of younger attorneys and I expect you to jump in and do it.” Lund said that she
responded, “No other major employer uses that business model,” to which Lindquist reportedly
replied, “All of them do!” After the exchange, Lund sent a text message to another DPA to
document Lindquist’s statement, which she believed was ageist: “We don’t promote based on
ability, experience, (can’t remember third, but like time w/ office), we are here to cultivate the
careers of younger attorneys. I expect you to assist. (quote).”

Lindquist said that he probably did not use those words, but does believe that one of the
organization’s goals is to cultivate younger talent. Sheeran had been telling him that Nelson
needed to try Class A felonies and they were looking for a position for him. Lindquist told me
that he was “trying to cultivate the careers of the young trial attorneys and give them a chance to
try big cases.”

I find that Lindquist made the statement quoted in the text message for the following
reasons: Lund has nothing to gain (in fact, she is concerned that she has everything to lose) by
making the statement; she recounted the statement contemporaneously in a text message to a
coworker; and, Lindquist agreed that he transferred Nelson to Class A felonies (instead of Lund)
because he was “trying to cultivate the careers of the young trial attorneys.”

6.. Lindquist Prefers to Hire Physically Attractive People.

Allegation: The Penner Complaint alleged generally that Lindquist prefers to hire and
surround himself with physically attractive people; he offers jobs and assignments to attractive
people over potentially more qualified candidates; and, he jokingly used the phrase, “the person
meets our hiring criteria,” as a euphemism for being physically attractive.

Summgy of the Factual Findings: Lindquist has made remarks about the physical
appearance of candidates and appearance is a factor in his decision-making.

Summgy of the Evidence: Penner said the Lindquist has commented a couple of times,
“She meets our hiring criteria,” followed by a laugh, referring to the candidate’s appearance.
Lindquist denied commenting on a candidate’s physical appearance, but said he has expressed
the opinion that it is important to hire people who present well in court. Physical appearance is
not a factor, according to Lindquist — rather, what is important is how the person conducts
him/herself. Farina likewise denied hearing Lindquist comment on a candidate’s looks and
emphasized that she has interviewed all interns, volunteers, DPAs and support staff with him.
She said that Lindquist explains in the interviews that he is looking for the “trifecta” (if the
applicant a good colleague, a good worker and a good emissary for the office).

<mark>Robnett had a different recollection; she said that Lindquist wanted to know applicants
appearance before he hired them. She recalled Lindquist asking what pending hires looked like -
“It mattered to him.” Former PCPAO Human Resources Manager Becky Stover said that she
heard Lindquist ask several times if a female applicant was “HWP,” meaning “height weight
proportionate.” One of Lindquist’s team chiefs recalled Lindquist commenting that two young
Misdemeanor DPAs (male and female) were “incredibly good-looking people.” The team chief
observed that it was an “odd thing to say about coworkers.”</mark>

I find on the basis of these witnesses” testimony that the physical appearance of
candidates is a factor that Lindquist considers during the hiring process, but not a motivating
factor in his decision-making. I further find that he has made comments about the physical
characteristics of both employees and applicants.
More Specifically, Penner also offered the following as examples of Lindquist’s focus on
physical appearance during the hiring process.

a. Appeals Division Hire. Penner’s Complaint alleged that the
Appeals Division hires two new law students every year for two-year internships. In 2013,
<mark>Lindquist allegedly passed over the top choice of Kit Proctor, Chief of the Appeals Division, and
selected two lesser-ranked choices because the top candidate was overweight.</mark> One of these two
choices then decided at the last minute not to start the position, leaving the Appeals Division one
intern short for the next two years.

Penner said that Proctor ranked four candidates and sent them to Lindquist and Farina for
interviews. He said someone told him that the top ranked candidate was overweight and
Lindquist and Farina picked the second and the third ranked applicants. He never heard why they
chose them. When one of the candidates refused the offer, Penner went back and made an offer to
the first candidate, who had taken another job by that time.

Lindquist did not recall the selection process. Farina simply recalled interviewing interns
from the appellate unit and agreeing on the top candidate with the qualifications and personality
to argue before the Court of Appeals. She did not recall a candidate being overweight.

Proctor said she sent three candidates to Lindquist for final approval. She confirmed that
her first choice (female) was not selected, but did not recall much weight difference between her
first two choices, both women. Proctor recalled that she discussed all three candidates with
Lindquist aner he interviewed them and said that Lindquist liked her favorite candidate, but “just
really liked the guy,” the third candidate.

I find no basis to conclude that Lindquist rejected the first candidate because of her
appearance.

b. Public Information Officer. Penner’s Complaint alleged that
Lindquist created a “public information officer” position in 2013 and selected a new legal
assistant with no legal experience in media relations to fill the position. The Complaint stated
that “the basis for the decision appeared to be that she was young and physically attractive.”
Lindquist gave her an office next to his. The woman, who had been hired to be a legal assistant,
ended up quitting after having to write press releases about the horrific crimes prosecuted by the
office.

In addition to the above, Penner said that he met Emily Conlee, Communications
Assistant, soon after she started. Conlee told him that she was hired as an extra-hire legal
assistant and shortly afterwards was hired to do communications work. Lindquist recalled that
he wanted to “open [the hiring process] up,” but Farina said that she had a good person for the
position who was articulate and a good writer. Farina said that Conlee was a volunteer legal
assistant, but had done some communications work in a previous job.36 Farina said the move
was a band aid fix; HR Manager Becky Stover had been doing both HR and communications and
the office wanted to split the jobs. Stover said she was happy to focus on just one job and
Conlee was competent and capable with relevant experience. Lindquist’s assistant, Kelly
Kelstrup recalled that Conlee was a legal assistant in the office already and had a lot of web
experience, which she believed was the reason Conlee was selected for the position. Kelstrup
didn’t think that her selection was because of her appearance. Stover said that Conlee resigned
because she wanted to go to law school and she had to prepare for the LSAT exam.

I find no basis to conclude that Lindquist selected Conlee because of her appearance.

c. Legal Assistant in the Homicide Unit. Penner’s Complaint
alleged that Lindquist made the final decision to hire a legal assistant in the homicide unit in
2013 based on her appearance because he had to walk past her every time he goes to his office.
Penner said that Lindquist commented in a meeting that he wanted to make sure the hire
was someone that he didn’t mind looking at because he has to walk by there every day. Penner
also stated that the person hired, Dani Crosswhite, was attractive but also a very good legal
assistant. Lindquist said that the allegation was “absolutely false” and didn’t know who Penner
was talking about. Sheeran, who would have made hiring recommendations to Lindquist,

according to Penner, said “I believe I know what happened; the only other person being
considered was grumpy.”

I find that physical appearance was not the motivating factor in Lindquist’s selection.

(1. Misdemeanor DPA. The Penner Complaint alleged that in 2014
three DPA positions became available in the Misdemeanor Division. Misdemeanor Chief Tim
Lewis and PCPAO HR Manager Lisa Hilligcss interviewed seven candidates and Lewis ranked
the successful candidate seventh. Nevertheless, Lindquist told him to make the candidate, an
attractive young woman, “passable.” Since then, she has performed poorly in trial.

Penner recalled being in a meeting with Lewis, who had seven candidates for the position
with the successful candidate ranked last. Lewis said in the meeting that the candidate was not
capable of doing the job, but Lindquist told him to do anything he could to make her “passable.”
Lindquist said that Lewis described the candidate as a very good colleague and a good emissary
for the office, but needed work as a trial attorney. Lindquist commented that a person can learn
trial skills, but not the ability to be a good colleague and emissary.

Lewis said that the allegations were “all correct”: he had concerns about the candidate’s
capabilities; she was not at par with her counterparts; Lindquist said he wanted Lewis to work
with her in an effort to irnprove her proficiency as a DPA. Lewis finther stated that Lindquist
asked whether she got along with her colleagues, to which Lewis replied, “She represents the
office well, but I am not sure if she can become a good trial attorney.” By way of context,
Lewis added that two other applicants graduated in the top 5% of their class and presented well
in front of a jury; he said the successful applicant did not have those skills and did not compare
well with them. Finally, Hilligoss recalled giving the candidate (who was “cute”) a rating of 2
out of 5, which placed her at the bottom of the group. She said she was disappointed but not
surprised when Lindquist selected the candidate —— he wanted her name to come forward, so she
obviously had an edge. Hilligoss also commented that the hire meant that the office was unable
to hire another male temporary, who both she and Lewis said was a very good lawyer.
 

<hr>

3‘5 Conlee’s resume indicates that she “Designed and drafted content for the website and for advertising brochures”
for the law firm that employed her immediately prior to her job at the PCPAO.



This allegation and hiring process presents an opportunity to explain more fully the
“trifecta,” the criteria Lindquist uses to assess the performance of his staff. As noted, Lindquist
implemented a new performance evaluation form that emphasized a set of “core values,” which
have come to be known as the “trifecta:”

I Good Worker — Consistently carries out duties of the job, meets expectations, and
performs professionally.

I Good Colleague - Consistently promotes good will, supports co-workers, and
treats them respectfully and professionally.

I Good Emissa_ry for the Office — Consistently represents the office well with
members of the justice system and the community at large, advances goals of the ofiice, and acts
professionally.

Note that only one of these three values focuses on good work; two of them instead focus
on relationships, both within and outside the office. In the case of the Misdemeanor hiring
process, Lindquist emphasized the fact that the successful candidate was a good colleague, in. ,
she got along well with her coworkers. I find that the candidate’s “cute” appearance for
Lindquist was a plus factor when considering whether she would make a “good emissary,” that
is, represent the office well in the public and the community. These two values apparently
overwhelmed the undisputed fact that the successful candidate was not a capable trial lawyer,
either before or after she was hired. The situation underscores Lindquist’s stated belief that a
person can learn trial skills, but not the ability to be a good colleague and a good emissary.”

<hr>

37 Notably, being a good trial attorney does not appear to be a factor in Lindquist‘s assessment of whether a DPA is
a good emissary of the PCPAO.


# See H. Violation of Whistleblower Act

1. Steve Merrival.

Allegation: Penner’s Complaint alleged that after Merrival filed his Complaint, Lindquist
directed Farina to appear on camera and Asst. Team Chief of the Civil Division, Denise Greer, to
issue a written statement that Merrival was a disgruntled employee because he had been passed
over for leadership positions. Penner said that Merrival was the drug trial team negotiator,
enjoyed his position and never sought a. leadership position. Penner's Complaint further alleged
that Lindquist stated at leadership meetings that Merrival had a “meltdown” and was not acting
“adult or mature.” Penner and Greer advised Lindquist to stop criticizing Merrival publicly.

Summgy of the Factual Findings: The PCPAO issued statements to the press after
Merrival filed his Complaint that he was disgruntled and unhappy because he was passed over
for leadership positions; the PCPAO’s statements were inaccurate and intentionally misleading;
Lindquist intended that the description of Merrival as a disgruntled employee would place him in
a negative light and thereby minimize the impact of the Complaint on himself and the PCPAO.

Summary of the Evidence: Greer said that leadership gathered to respond to the TNT’s
request for a comment about the Merrival Complaint, which was the office’s first notice of it.

She said that the two statements were based on the group’s knowledge of Merrival’s employment

history, 113., no one reviewed his employee file. Lindquist asked her to issue the written
statement because the Chief of the Civil Division was not available.33

All leadership witnesses said that the characterization of Merrival as being “disgruntled”
for being passed over was based on two things: (1) a statement by Merrival in the Complaint
(“Younger or inexperienced staff, who are reputed to be in favor with Lindquist, are appointed to
leadership roles and given administrative tasks associated with increased earnings such as Erika
Nohavec, Team Leader; Michelle Hyer, Team Chief; Scott Peters, Team Chief; Jared Ausserer,
Homicide Chief vis a vis Jim Schacht, Steve Merrival, etc”); and, (2) Merrival’s resentment
when Maureen Goodman was appointed his Team Chief.

Goodman stated in a declaration submitted in support of Lindquist’s and Farina’s
opposition to a WSBA Bar Complaint against them: “In May, 2012, I was appointed Team
Chief of the Drug Unit and returned to that unit. I heard from a co-worker at that time that Mr.
Merrival said he was not happy I was appointed because I had less experience than he had.“

Goodman said that Merrival told her that she was not as experienced as others, but seemed to
accept that she was a hard worker and doing a good job.

Merrival denied being disgruntled and the TNT article that reported his Complaint
included the following quote from him: “I’m not a disgruntled employee. I’m a person who’s
committed to justice here.” Merrival said that he never sought appointment to Mark Lindquist’s
administration — he did not want “any part of Mr. Lindquist’s administration.”


<hr>

3“ Greer pointed out that her written statement did not use the word, “disgruntled;“ the TNT article quoted her as
saying Merrival was “unhappy that he has been passed over for leadership positions.” “Staffer Files Whistleblower
Complaint Against Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist,” Tacoma News Tribune, May 13, 2015.


HR Manager Lisa Hilligoss could not recall leadership referring to Merrival negatively
until his complaint. She said that leadership has said that Merrival “retired on the job,“ but
indicated he was doing a “decent enough job.“ Hilligoss further stated that she sits at the table
when promotions discussed and was not aware that Merrival was ever upset for not being
promoted. Another DPA said that Lindquist always praised Merrival for the number of cases
that he processed in the drug unit and said that iabeiing him “disgruntled” was “embarrassing.“
One senior leader said that the label was Lindquist’s “sound bite” for Merrival.

Multiple witnesses also confirmed that Lindquist said in a leadership meeting that
Merrival had a “meltdown.“ This statement is similar to what Lindquist was reported to have

said when Robnett went on leave of absence and then quit her position as Chief Criminal
Deputy, 1'. e. , that she had a “breakdown.”

<mark>I find that the PCPAO’s statements to the press in response to Merrival’s complaint were
inaccurate and intentionally misleading.</mark> At most, Merrival’s Complaint and his statement to
Goodman indicate a frustration that the Lindquist administration did not place a high value on
seniority in the PCPAO, or experience generally. Importantly, leadership viewed Merrival in a
rather benign way before his Complaint — he was no “star” but he played a useful role. <mark>It wasn’t
until after he filed the Complaint did he become “disgruntled“ about being passed up for
leadership. Furthermore, by describing his behavior as a “meltdown,“ Lindquist suggested that
Merrival’s complaint was the product of a disorder, rather than a response to perceived
grievances and injustices. I conclude that Lindquist used the “sound bite” of Merrival as a
disgruntled employee to place him in a negative light and thereby minimize the impact of the
Complaint on himself and the PCPAO.</mark>

2. Steve Penner.

Allegation: The Penner Complaint alleged that Penner suggested to Lindquist that he
stop criticizing Merrival publicly, and that Lindquist’s comments could be the basis of a
retaliation claim. Afterwards, Lindquist admonished Penner for not “being present” or showing
leadership regarding Merrival and Farina criticized him for a comment supportive of Merrival
posted by his fiance on a TNT site.

Summary of the Factual Findings: Penner told Lindquist that he should stop criticizing
Merrival publicly; Penner’s resistance to labeling Merrival and Penner fiance’s support of him
precipitated Lindquist to confront Penner about whether Penner should remain a senior leader in
the office.

Summa_ry of the Evidence: Penner said he commented in a senior leadership meeting that
they needed to stop criticizing Merrival publicly and shouldn’t use the word “meltdown.”

During the meeting, Penner said that Farina chastised him about his fiance’s statement in the
comment section of the TNT when she “agreed” that Merrival was a good guy After the
meeting, Lindquist told Penner that he is not “showing enough“ on the issue of Merrival’s
complaint and he didn’t appear to be “present.” The next morning Lindquist asked Penner to
take a walk with him and mentioned again that Penner was not showing leadership. Finally, that
afternoon Lindquist told Penner that the Chief of the Criminal Division might not be the best
position for him. Lindquist asked Penner how many hours he worked and Penner responded that
he worked 35-40 hours a week. Lindquist replied that it was not enough — he should be working
50-60 hours a week.39

Lindquist said that after the Merrival Complaint he told Penner that “now is the time for
the Chief Criminal Deputy to step up and keep the staff focused on the mission at hand and avoid
the distractions." He further stated that the job cannot be done in 30-35 hours a week; we need
people who are passionate about the office. When Penner said he cared about justice, Lindquist
said he responded, “If you don’t put the time in, then use of the word “j ustice” is just a
platitude.” Lindquist said that he expected Penner to offer to step up and work harder, but he did

not hear that from him. Finally, Lindquist said that he had similar conversations with Penner
previously.

Farina said there had been a concern among the senior leaders about Penner’s hours of
work — he came in late and leh early and always went out at lunch“) She had also been involved
in conversations with Penner specifically about the Chief Criminal Deputy position. Farina and
Ausserer described a conversation with Penner in September 2014 about unprofessional conduct
at a TPCBA event with his fiance (now wife), a criminal defense attorney. Penner apparently
responded that his relationship would continue and maybe the Chief Criminal Deputy position
might not be the best fit under the circumstances. Farina also said that she noted concerns
regarding Penner’s performance in an evaluation in December 2014 and said that Penner
admitted he needed to improve in the areas noted.“1 Lastly, Farina admitted telling Penner in a
meeting that it was inappropriate for Penner’s then fiance to post an on—line comment in support
of Merrival. She felt that this was an example of Penner failing to communicate with others.

I find that Lindquist’s motives in admonishing Penner after Merrival filed his Complaint
were mixed: he and Farina were not satisfied with Penner’s work ethic and communication
style, among other concerns; and, Lindquist perceived that Penner’s loyalties were divided and
his support of the office was insufficient to warrant him retaining the highest position in the
Criminal Division. The evidence indicates that Lindquist, Farina, Penner and others all
wondered at times whether he was suited for the position of Chief Criminal Deputy. I find,
however, that <mark>Penner’s resistance to labeling Merrival and his fiance’s support of him
precipitated Lindquist to confront Penner about whether Penner should remain a senior leader in
the office.</mark>

35' The PCPAO is on a 35-hour workweek.

Prosecutor Mark Lindquist and Pierce County Prosecutor’s Office Chief of Staff Dawn Farina,” pp. 1T-1 8.

II. Abuse of Authority

A. Media Statements Conveying Guilt

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that Lindquist made statements to
the media that conveyed the guilt of criminal defendants (citing examples).

Summa_ry of the Factual Conclusions: Interpreting and applying the Rules of
Professional Conduct {“RPC”} is beyond the scope of this investigation.

Summgy of the Evidence: The allegation requires a legal analysis under the
Rules of Professional Conduct. For example, RPC 3.6 Trial Publicity, subsection (a),
provides:

“A lawyer who is participating or has participated in the investigation or litigation
of a matter shall not make an extrajudicial statement that the lawyer knows or
reasonably should know will be disseminated by means of public communication

and will have substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative
proceeding in the matter.”

RPC 3.8(f) also provides, in part, that a prosecutor shall “refrain from making

extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public
condemnation of the accused. . . I”

Lindquist said that he is acquainted with the RPCs and that public statements by
him should be limited to the public record, including the affidavit of probable cause that
accompanies any criminal charges. Before making a statement, Lindquist said that he
reads the affidavit and uses only information in it that is admissible. Heather Songer, the
office’s Communications Assistant, confirmed that Lindquist restated facts contained in
the affidavit. Penner said that Lindquist told him that he should put information about the

defendant’s criminal history in the probable cause summary so that Lindquist could tell
the media about it.

In any event, <mark>interpreting and applying the RPCs is beyond the scope of this
investigation, so I will refrain from addressing the allegation.</mark> However, I requested
copies all of the PCPAO’s public statements, which Songer provided to me on the disk
attached as Exhibit 5. I understand that this allegation is a subject of a complaint to the
Washington State Bar Association (“WSBA”), which has the jurisdiction and expertise to
adjudicate it.42

2015:

B. Exercising Undue Influence Over Media Coverage

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that Lindquist “expends inordinate public
resources” to secure favorable media coverage “that best promotes Lindquist or his version of
events, and disparages his adversaries.”

Summgy of the Factual Findings: Lindquist has not exercised “undue influence over
media coverage;” however, Lindquist spends a substantial amount of time attempting to shape

the media’s coverage of himself and the PCPAO; and, the amount of time and effort Lindquist

expends to secure favorable media coverage 1“ greater than previous Pierce County Prosecutors
and more than any other elected official who interacts with the TNT.

Summa_ry of the Evidence: Lindquist said that he wants the public to know what the
PCPAO is doing and why, which is the reason that he and the DPAs often appear in the media.

He further stated that the office is very seldom misrepresented in the media, but when DPAs say
that media coverage is inaccurate, he will give them a chance to set the record straight.

Clearly, however, Lindquist’s media activity is a departure from the past. One PCPAO
staff person, who has worked for multiple Prosecutors, observed that the PCPAO was “more
political" under Lindquist. The staff person noted that former Prosecutor Gerald Horne seldom
put out a press release (generally pertaining only to officer—involved incidents). In contrast,
Lindquist took the position “from day one” that the office was going to communicate actively
with the public. Each member of Lindquist’s senior leadership recalled making trips with him to
the TNT’s offices, either to review stories that were slated for publication or, more frequently, to
respond to stories, usually involving the Dalsing or Nissan cases.

I contacted Karen Peterson, Executive Editor of the TNT, to get her response to
this allegation, but she declined to speak with me. However, the TNT ran a column she
wrote on August 15, 2015 in response to a Facebook post by Ausserer. Ms. Peterson
noted, “Since he took office in 2009, Lindquist has been far quicker than any public
official we deal with to pick up the phone and complain about a story.” In particular, she
recounted numerous meetings with Lindquist about the Dalsing matter, “with hour-long
phone calls to the reporter and editors, sometimes during work hours, sometimes late at
night.” Lindquist generally recalled the meetings Ms. Peterson described in her column
and said he “may have called the 'INT between 7:00 am. and 8:00 pm.” <mark>Lindquist’s
“pattern” led Ms. Peterson to conclude, “This was no longer about correcting the record,
but shaping it.”</mark> Finally, in response to this specific allegation in the Merrival Complaint,
Ms. Peterson wrote:

We published this quote from Lindquist in a June 20 story: “The Prosecutor’s Ofnce retiled
charges against Lynn Dalsing when it learned she knew her husband was sexually abusing their
daughter, and she facilitated this abuse by continuing to leave her daughter alone with him.”

As with quotes made by deputy prosecutors in other stories, it was an allegation stated as a fact.
And this one came after charges against Dalsing were dismissed.

His continued pressing to influence our coverage might not violate the law, and
anyone who is the subject of contentious coverage is welcome to be heard by
editors before or after publication. But the degree and persistence of his time
spent on his image may concern the citizens who pay his salary. Prosecutors are
Spending a lot of time doing this on the clock.“13

Mary Robnett, Lindquist’s former Chief Criminal Deputy, observed <mark>"A lot of stuff he
does is political; before he took over, the office was business; now it is ‘how is this going to
play; how is this going to look?" She said that Prosecutors Ladenburg and Horne told her to go
ahead and do the right thing for the right reasons and they could always explain what happened if
the decision turned out to be unpopular. In contrast, she said that Lindquist cared a great deal
about public perception and made decisions about allocation of resources and running of the
office based, in part, on how much publicity (positive and negative) it was going to generate.
For example, Robnett recalled a comment made by Lindquist after the murders of the four
Lakewood police officers. She said that Lindquist spent significant time at the crime scene.
Later, he commented that he was going to have to run for re-election and would get $100K of
free publicity from the murders. Lindquist’s comment was continued by other witnesses.</mark>

In sum, I do not find that Lindquist has exercised “undue influence over media
coverage.” As Judge Sorenson observed, “Lindquist is an elected official; he has as much access
to the media as they will allow him; and, if it gives him the opportunity to speak to them about
their focus, then why wouldn’t he take advantage of it?” However, I do find the following:
<mark>Lindquist spends a substantial amount of time focused on attempting to shape the media’s
coverage of himself and the PCPAO; and, the amount of time and effort Lindquist expends “to
secure favorable media coverage” is greater than previous Pierce County Prosecutors and more
than any other elected official the TNT deals with.</mark>

C. Disregard of Apparent Conflicts of Interest

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that Lindquist intervened individually as a
party in the Nissan case (involving work texts on Lindquist’s personal phone), represented by
attorney Stewart Estes of the Keating, Bucklin & McCormack, Inc. law firm. The Complaint
claimed that Estes argued on Lindquist’s behalf against the County’s interests in fulfilling its

PRA obligations, while representing the County in other matters for which his firm has been paid
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Findings of Fact: Estes represents Lindquist in the Nissan PRA litigation on a pro bono
basis;“14 he has represented Lindquist in the Nissan case at the same time he has represented the
County in other matters;45 neither Estes nor his firm represented the County during Lindquist’s
administration prior to Estes“ appearance on behalf of Lindquist in December 2011; since that
time, the County has paid Estes’ firm $5 87,268.63 for legal work on behalf of the County and
Estes has represented the County in Dalsirig v. Pierce County, Ames v. Pierce County, Wright v.
Pierce County, and matters concerning the marijuana initiative.

4“ Representing a client without charge.

45 Estes’ alleged conflict of interest is a question of law, which I do not address in this report.




Summgy of the Evidence: Lindquist said that when Nissen requested his personal cell
phone records, the PCPAO’s Civil Division advised him not to turn them over. He wanted to be

transparent and turn over more records than the Civil Division advised him to release, but when
Nissen later modified the request to include “all telephone records,” he agreed to oppose the
request. Lindquist said that the PCPAO represented the PCPAO and the County in the
subsequent litigation?6 He believed that the Civil Division discussed the litigation and the
PCPAO’S representation of Pierce County with the County’s Risk Management Department.

Lindquist said that the Civil Division’s Litigation Team Lead, Dan Hamilton, wanted
Lindquist to intervene in the action to assert his constitutional rights, which he ultimately agreed
to do. The Civil Division recommended that he retain Stewart Estes to represent him. Lindquist
insisted that the County “has not paid a dime” to Estes and his firm because Estes has worked for

him on a pro bono basis. Lindquist believed that Estes first appeared on his behalf in the
litigation in December 2011.

Farina said that she was present when Hamilton insisted that Lindquist intervene in the
Nissen litigation. She recalled that Lindquist did not want to be a party but finally agreed.

Regarding representation of the County, Farina stated that the Civil Division would not normally

go to the County (e.g., the Risk Management Department) to get approval to appear on the
County’s behalf in litigation.

Hamilton said that he “worked over” Lindquist to convince him to intervene in
the litigation. Hamilton was concerned about an earlier PRA case” and believed that
Lindquist needed to be a party to assert various federal constitutional law claims.
Hamilton said that Lindquist originally was willing to give up all of his private cell phone
records (“as a politician, he didn’t seem to min ”), so the only reason Lindquist would
get involved in the case was to help the County. He pitched the idea to Lindquist of him
intervening with Estes as his counsel, so long as Estes was willing to do it on a pro bono
basis. Hamilton thought it would be a difficult sell if Lindquist had to pay Estes
personally. Hamilton said that he had worked on cases with Estes previously, so he
contacted him, asked him to represent Lindquist and told him the County could not pay
him. Estes indicated that he was interested and agreed to represent Lindquist. Hamilton
recalled that Estes first appeared in the litigation in November or early December 2011.

He said that there was no quid pro quo offered to Estes to represent Lindquist because the
County had no cases in the pipeline to offer him.

4'5 The defendants in the Nissen litigation included Pierce County, the PCPAO and Lindquist.

47" O'Neill v. City of Shoreline, 170 Wn.2d 138 (2010) (an electronic version of a document stored on a personal
computer, including its embedded metadata, is a public record subject to disclosure).



Hamilton also noted that the County’s and Lindquist’s interests were “cheek to
jow .” He said it was in the County’s interest to protect the private records of all County
employees, whether it was Lindquist or another County employee, so it never dawned on
him or others that there may be a conflict between them. Hamilton went on to say that
their interests could diverge if the County wanted to give up Lindquist’s phone records,

but it was the Prosecutor’s decision whether the County continued to oppose the record
request.

Hamilton explained that, unless a particular department is a named party, then the
Prosecutor makes the decisions regarding the defense of the County, ag, a tort claim
against the County alone. If an individual employee is alleged to have committed the
tort, then his/her department is involved in making decisions about litigation strategy, but
not litigation tactics. Also, if money is involved, then the Risk Management Department
must be consulted because it is reSponsible for making payments. Hamilton explained
that in the Nissan litigation, Lindquist was the individual personally involved as a named

defendant in the litigation, but he was also the head of the affected department, so he was
the Civil Division’s “clien .”

Pierce County Risk Manager Mark Maenhout said he asked Hamilton who
represented the County in Nissan and Hamilton responded that the PCPAO was
responsible for making decisions about the case. Consequently, Maenhout said the Civil
Division has kept him at an arms-length regarding Nissan matters and all decisions about
defense of the case. For example, he has had no discussions with the Civil Division
about settlement of the Nissan litigation because “they manage the litigation." He noted
that the County Code states that the Prosecutor or his/her designee and the Risk
Management Department must both sign an agreement to settle a civil case, so the
County could not settle Nissan without the Prosecutor’s approval (or visa versa).

Regarding Lindquist’s retention of Estes as his individual counsel, Maenhout said that he
first became aware of Estes’ involvement at the oral argument before the Washington Supreme
Court. Maenhout said that neither Estes nor his firm had represented the County, at least during
Lindquist’s administration, prior to Estes’ appearance on behalf of Lindquist in December
2011.48 Since that time, the County has paid Estes“ firm $587,268.63 for legal work on behalf of
the County, and Estes has performed work for the County in the following matters: Dolsing v.

Pierce County, Amas v. Pierce County, Nissan 12. Pierce County, Wright v. Pierce County, and
issues involving the marijuana initiative.

D. Improper Use of Public Resources

The Merrival Complaint made numerous allegations that generally portray the PCPAO as
a politicized work environment. By way of context, numerous witnesses drew comparisons
between the Lindquist administration and those of his predecessors. For example, one Team
Chief said that politics under Lindquist’s administration is “more to the forefront” than under
Prosecutors Ladenburg or Horne, who had strict policies that DPAs do their job and politics
didn’t matter. A long-term DPA added that during Ladenburg’s two election campaigns, he told
the DPAs he did not want their financial support or their volunteer work; doing good prosecution
work should be their focus. He said the clear message was that politics and the work of the
office were separate.

<hr>

43 The County paid Estes’ firm $1,348.32 during this time period for services provided by a firm lawyer as a neutral
arbitrator.



1. Political Support of Lindquist.

Allegation: Specifically, Merrival alleged that many, “if not all” employees fear not
supporting Lindquist or his chosen political candidates.

Summa_ry of the Factual Findings: The PCPAO is more politicized under Lindquist than
his predecessors and DPAs, particularly newer DPAs, feel pressured to volunteer in support of

his campaigns; Lindquist’s refusal to act in the face of complaints by PCPAO employees that
their names were added to a Lindquist recall campaign Facebook group without their consent is
clear evidence of this pressure, and Lindquist’s active support of campaign activities in his
office; political support of Lindquist is not essential to advancement in the office because many
persons in his leadership have either been neutral politically or supported other persons;

however, DPAs must give Lindquist their unqualified loyalty in the office, or risk having their
careers dead—ended.

Summgy of the Evidence: Lindquist said that he could not speak to what employees felt,
but no one should feel pressured to be involved in his political campaigns. All witnesses said

that Lindquist does not accept financial contributions to his campaigns from DPAs, but does
accept volunteers, or ”sweat equity” as he told a couple of witnesses. One of them said that as
time went by the takeaway for him was that sweat equity would be rewarded and participation
could affect his job assignment. One Team Chief concurred, saying that the perception among
DPAs is that people who support Lindquist get rewarded; and, if they get involved in his
campaigns, they will be rewarded, too. Another Team Chief said that the perception is
particularly acute in the Misdemeanor Division, where the DPAs are brand new to the office and
sometimes not in permanent positions. So, if they think that participating in a Lindquist
campaign event will give them an advantage, then they do it, particularly if other DPAs were
participating, too.

A different Team Chief declared, “Absolutely, the office is political,” and noted that all
the Misdemeanor DPAs attended Lindquist’s campaign kick-off wearing campaign t-shirts. He
told the story of one DPA, whose girlfriend’s parents were in town and all of them had plans to
go out to dinner. Unfortunately, the dinner conflicted with Lindquist‘s campaign kickoff. The
Team Chief told the DPA unequivocally that he should go to dinner with his girlfriend and
family. Later, the Team Chief saw the DPA at the campaign kickoff handing out donation cards
and wearing the campaign t-shirt — “I am going to meet them for dessert,” he said.

A number of witnesses said that Lindquist does not solicit DPA participation in his
campaign; rather, it is done by his campaign manager or treasurer (both DPAs) or others active
in his campaign. For example, the Pierce County Human Resources Department recently
received a complaint that DPAs who supported Lindquist added PCPAO employees to a
“Support Our Prosecutor” Facebook group without their knowledge or consent.“ A DPA
reported that at least 14 employees were very upset but did not want to be identified for fear of
retaliation. When the Pierce County HR Director requested that all employees added without
their consent be removed, Lindquist said he cannot direct his DPA supporters to do so because
they were engaging in free speech as private citizens. Lindquist said that his DPA supporters
had a right to add anyone they wanted and he would not tell them otherwise, “The individuals
can ask themselves to be removed.” One PCPAO employee who asked to be removed has filed a
complaint alleging that her job transfer shortly after she removed her name was retaliatory.

Finally, Merrival alleged that Lindquist has substituted the code-required merit system of
employment with a system based on patronage, ie. , unquestionable loyalty to promoting Mark
Lindquist. Lindquist called the allegation is “absurd on its face;” when you look at people he has
promoted, the majority of them are apolitical (to his knowledge) or even opposed to him. Farina
and other senior leaders said the same thing, identifying individuals in each category. For
example, Penner said he never supported Lindquist politically, but was appointed to high office.
He said that some people enjoy politics and Lindquist is charismatic, so it is hard to discern the
difference between volunteerism and quid pro quo. Penner said he didn’t see a connection
between political support and advancement.

I find that the PCPAO is more politicized under Lindquist than his predecessors, and
DPAs, particularly newer DPAs, feel pressured to volunteer in support of his campaigns.
Lindquist’s refusal to act in the face of complaints by PCPAO employees that their names were
added to a Lindquist campaign F acebook group without their consent is clear evidence of this
pressure, and Lindquist’s active support of campaign activities in his office. That said, it is also
apparent that political support of Lindquist is not essential to advancement in the office because
many persons in his leadership have either been neutral politically or supported other persons.
However, it is important for DPAs to give Lindquist their unqualified loyalty in the office, or
risk having their careers dead-ended. See, Section VI, fajita.

2. Visible Positions in the Community.

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged: “DPAs are encouraged to obtain visible
positions in the community to bring favorable publicity to Lindquist’s office.” Merrival further
stated that some DPAs were promised judicial appointments in exchange for their service.

Summa_ry of the Factual Findings: DPAs are not required to obtain visible positions in
the community to be a “good emissary“ of the office; Lindquist encourages persons interested
in attaining public office to be active in their community; <mark>Lindquist has attempted to create a
politically powerful office that can produce judges, and make DPAs interested in becoming
judges beholden to him</mark>; the whistleblower complaints reflect, in part, a belief among career
DPAs that the politicization of the PCPAO under Lindquist and the high value he places on
loyalty to his administration <mark>interferes with the delivery of justice in Pierce County</mark>.



<hr>

49 The Facebook page apparently was created in response to the Lindquist recall campaign.



Summa_ry of the Evidence: As noted, one of the PCPAO’s core values is being a “good
emissary.” Initially, employees believed that required them to attain visible positions in the
community. However, Lindquist explained to the office that “good emissary” instead meant
that DPAs should engage in professional interactions with the public because the PCPAU serves
the public. In contrast, he has told DPAs interested in being a judge to get involved in
community service groups, regardless of the group. Farina and other leadership witnesses
agreed. She said that being a “good emissary” does not mean volunteering; a DPA can be one
in the courthouse doing their job professionally. She also said that DPAs are very active in the
community by individual choice; she didn’t run for President of the TPCBA and Team Chief
Michelle Walker didn’t become Mayor of Roy for Lindquist. Farina concurred that Lindquist
advises DPAs interested in running for public office to be out in their community. For example,
she said DPAs have chosen to run for Fire Commissioner because it is in the DPAs’ interest;
firefighters are active politically and their support is helpful.

Former Chief Criminal Deputy Mary Robnett said that Lindquist’s interest in judgeships
was more active and political than Lindquist or Farina stated. She said that Lindquist expressed
the belief that PCPAO should be a place that produced judges and he set out to make that a
reality. “He wanted a political machine. He said he wanted the most politically powerful office
in the County, and for Superior Court judges to be concerned that he could get people to run
against them.” Former Team Chief Sunni Ko said that Lindquist also wanted DPAs to believe
that he could make them judges and ask him for assistance so they would be beholden to him.
A senior leader observed that Lindquist has always said that he could put people on the bench,
so he engaged in resume—building, such as putting DPAs in the Homicide Chief position. A
person who wanted to be a judge aligned themselves with Lindquist and it worked.

One of the former DPAs who received Lindquist’s support and who now sits on the
Pierce County Superior Court bench, Judge Phillip Sorenson, said that he felt no angst about.
Lindquist encouraging DPAs to be a part of the political system as judges, mayors, precinct
officers and members of various committees. He said DPAs are all members of the community

and more involvement is better, and it is an added benefit if the involvement reflects well on the
office.

It probably comes as no surprise to many people that a politician, like Lindquist, uses his
political support and energies to expand his political influence. The conflict for many long-term
prosecutors appears to stem from their belief that <mark>the PCPAO’s role is to "do justice" for the
people of Pierce County. As Penner stated, "to do justice is a very cool responsibility and
unique opportunity to try to come to the right result for the community, the defendant and the
court system. Merrival gets that." The Merrival and Penner Complaints reflect, in part, a belief
that the politicization of the PCPAO under Lindquist and the high value he places on loyalty to
his administration interferes with the delivery of justice in Pierce County.</mark>

3. Increased Participation Within the TPCBA.

Allegation: Lindquist, Farina and other leadership witnesses said that the PCPAO was
relatively inactive in the TPCBA when Lindquist was appointed in 2009. They said that officers
of the local bar requested that the PCPAO, as the largest “law firm” in Pierce County, take a
more active in bar activities. The Merrival Complaint essentially alleged that Lindquist“s efforts
to assume a bigger presence in the TPCBA went too far. It claimed that leadership prepared

work emails directing DPAs to vote in Bar elections, suggested who to vote for and then
collected ballots to insure their delivery.

Summgy of the Factual Findings: The PCPAO encouraged DPAs to become more
active in the Bar; Farina emailed DPAs to encourage them to vote in TPCBA elections and

identified who from the office was running; senior leaders offered to take ballots to the Bar

office; and, the names of DPAs who voted in the SAU were listed on a white board to pressure
them publicly to vote.

Summa_ry of the Evidence: Lindquist was unapologetic about the office’s efforts to
encourage DPAs to become more active in the Bar; he said that building relationships in the Bar
allows the PCPAO do its job better. He told Farina that leadership should email DPAs to
encourage them to vote in TPCBA elections and to identify who from the office was running.
And, he had “no problem“ with senior leaders offering to take ballots to the Bar office.

Farina said that senior leaders instructed Team Chiefs to encourage DPAs to vote and to
make sure they voted so that their voice could be heard within the Bar. In addition, Farina

routinely sent out emails to DPAs when the TPCBA ballots were delivered, such as this one she
sent on January 23, 2012:

It is imperative that our office vote for those attorneys who will effectively
represent our best interests and the best interests of the justice system. Please
give strong consideration to voting for Stephanie Bloomfield for Vice-President,
and Grant Blinn, Michelle Luna-Green and Matthew Thomas for Trustee. . .If

anyone would like me to return your completed ballot to the bar office, I would be
happy to do so.“50

The Merrival Complaint also alleged that “One unit advertised on their whiteboard a
checklist of who had voted.” Farina was running for TPCBA President at the time, so the
office’s “get out the vote” effort was especially intense. One DPA said the unit involved was the
SAU, where the Team Chief wrote every DPA’s name on the white board and crossed out
persons who had voted.51 She said that Felony Division Chief John Sheeran was collecting
ballots. The DPA kept telling Sheeran that she had not received a ballot, so he printed one off
for her and gave it to her. At the end, only three attorneys (including her) did not have their
names crossed out.


<hr>

5” Blinn and Luna-Green were DPAs at the time; Thomas was a former DPA.




Tom Howe, another DPA who did not vote, said that he saw the list of names and asked,
“What’s that all about?” He was told that it was a list kept by Sheeran of people who had given
him their election ballots. Howe said he was trying to keep his head down but was curious about
how far the office would press the situation. He said Sheeran approached him and said that it
was important that he vote because Farina is running for President and it would be important to
have her represent the PCPAO. Howe recalled that he told Sheeran that he didn’t know who
opposed her and didn’t know Farina well, so he was not going to vote. He said his decision was
thoughtful, but he knew at the time that he was “committing employment suicide“ and would
never be included in leadership. Consequently, he took a job at the AG’S office he had turned

down a month earlier because of the pay cut. He said, “I left because it got to the point where
there was no decision too small to politicize.”

I find that the allegations in the Merrival Complaint are true and undisputed: the PCPAO
encouraged DPAs to become more active in the Bar; Farina emailed DPAs to encourage them to

vote in TPCBA elections and identified who from office was running; senior leaders offered to
take ballots to the Bar office; and, the names of DPAs who voted in the SAU were listed on a
white board to pressure them publicly to vote.

4. TPCBA Judicial Qualifications Committee.

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that Lindquist placed “his DPAs” on the
TPCBA Judicial Qualifications Committee to support his judicial candidates and to disfavor
those he opposed. It stated that Farina appointed “inexperienced DPA Tim Lewis as Co—Chair“
for that purpose.

Summm of the Factual Findings: Lindquist has not affirmatively placed “his DPAs” on
the TPCBA Judicial Evaluation Committee; Farina appointed Lewis and civil attorney Margaret
Archer to co-chair the Committee because of their prior participation and to balance the
leadership between civil and criminal attorneys; and, neither Lindquist nor “his DPAs” have had
an inordinate or unfair influence on the Committee’s deliberations.52

Summgy of the Evidence: Lindquist said it was not true that he placed “his DPAs” on
Committee; he said he wasn’t even sure how he would do that. He also denied ever discussing
with DPAs on the Committee who they should support. Farina explained that as TPCBA Vice
President, she sat on the Committee for a year and got a chance to watch the “circus,” as she
called it. She said that most people on Committee were there for the right reasons, but some
attended to support/obj ect to a particular candidate. For that reason, Farina wanted to redesign
the Committee to reduce its size and to increase its diversity, while maintaining an even mix of
civil, criminal and family law attorneys from various practice areas. She said that Committee
members would laugh at the suggestion that Lindquist controlled it; the membership includes
criminal defense attorneys who have their own opinions.

<hr>

51 A photograph of the white board is attached as Exhibit 6.

52 DPAs regularly appear before Pierce County judges so it is both appropriate and valuable to have their input on
the Committee.





Lewis said that Bar President Tom Quinlan, not Farina, suggested he volunteer for the
Committee because Quinlan wanted greater participation from the Prosecutors office. When
Farina was elected President of the Bar, she asked Lewis and Margaret Archer (a land use
attorney from Gordon Thomas Honeywell) to serve as co-chairs. They sat down with Farina
and developed a list of people who were representative and would show up and work regardless

of the candidate. Lewis said that neither Lindquist nor Farina have ever suggested to him who he
should support.

Archer said that she and Lewis were appointed by Stephanie Bloomfield (also from
Gordon Thomas Honeywell), the TPCBA President who preceded Farina. Archer said, “If Tim
was inexperienced, then so was I.” She said that Lindquist did not influence Bloomfield’s
selection of them to serve on the Committee and Farina selected them as co-chairs for two
reasons: to have one civil and one criminal attorney as co-chairs; and, their conduct on the
Committee the previous year was balanced. Archer offered an anecdote to emphasize the latter
point. She said that Lewis was worried about the perception of the Committee because of the
publicity surrounding the PCPAO, so he supported adding two more criminal defense lawyers to
make sure the Committee was perceived as balanced. Now the Committee has five defense
attorneys and two DPAs. Lastly, Archer said that the Committee adopted a policy starting with
its consideration of McCann that DPAs must recuse themselves if another DPA is up for
evaluation. The DPAs can provide input as any other reference, but are required to leave the
interview and cannot participate in the discussion or the anonymous vote afterwards. Archer
said that she has never seen Lewis act in an inappropriate or unbalanced way.

Merrival’s Complaint also alleged that Lindquist’s DPAs helped McCann and Pierce
County District Court Judge Jeanette Lineberry receive undeserved favorable ratings and
underrated Mary Robnett and Karl Williams relative to Lindquist’s hopefuls. With respect to
Lineberry and Williams, Archer said that Lewis recused himself from participating in their
evaluation, and all the candidates, including Lineberry, Williams and Sandy Allen, received the
same “exceptionally well qualified rating.” She also said the McCann’s evaluation was not
improperly influenced by Lindquist or the DPAs on the Committee — “The room was packed
with criminal defense attorneys.”53 Regarding the Committee’s ratings of Robnett, she and a
former member of the Committee said that the rules protecting the confidentiality of the
Committee’s proceedings prevented them from responding to specific questions about the
deliberations involving individual candidates.“


<hr>

53 Sarah Richardson, Team Chief of Family Support, said that Lewis was appointed co-chair the year that she started
on the Committee. She said that she has not gotten any impression that Lewis has an agenda; he has been open and
equal regarding his treatment of the candidates and has done a good job as co-chair. Richardson further stated that
neither he nor Farina have attempted to influence her in any way. Finally, she recalled that Sorenson and Lineberry





On the basis of this evidence, I find that Lindquist has not affirmatively placed “his
DPAs“ on the TPCBA Judicial Evaluation Committee, although their participation is consistent
with his desire that the PCPAO be more active in Bar activities; Farina appointed Lewis and
Archer to co-chair the Committee because of their prior participation and to balance the
leadership between civil and criminal attorneys; and, neither Lindquist nor “his DPAs” have had
an inordinate or unfair influence on the Committee’s deliberations.

III. Substantial and Specific Danger to the Public Health or Safety
A. Vindictive and Overzealous Prosecution

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that Lindquist has engaged in vindictive and
overzealous prosecution, citing the Dalsing and Hilltop Crips Gang cases as examples. The
Penner Complaint alleged that after the Dalsing criminal case was dismissed for vindictive
prosecution, civil DPAs were involved in discussions regarding whether to move for
reconsideration or to appeal. The Penner Complaint ihrther alleged that Penner raised concerns
during the conversation with Civil Division Chief Doug Vanscoy’s “initial” proposal to “appeal
and seek settlement of the civil suit.”

Summm of the Factual Findings: No DPAs agreed that the PCPAO engaged in
overzealous prosecution; I did not engage in fact-finding regarding the Dalsing case in an effort
to avoid second-guessing a Superior Court judge, who carefully reviewed all the evidence and
determined that the PCPAO engaged in vindictive prosecution of Dalsing; Asst. Chief Criminal
Deputy Greg Greer initiated the Hilltop Gang cases; the office did not file the charges for the
purposes of gaining publicity for Lindquist or the PCPAO; and, the Hilltop Gang cases were not
brought for racial or political reasons. I further find that Lindquist involved Civil Division
employees in the conversation among senior leaders about whether to appeal or seek
reconsideration of the vindictive prosecution dismissal of the Dalsing criminal case; civil DPAs
connected an appeal of the criminal matter with settlement of the civil case, but criminal DPAs

rejected the connection; I am unable to determine from the evidence whether Vanscoy was the
civil DPA who made the suggestion.

Summgy of the Evidence: Penner offered the opinion that there is “No real way to get
underneath the claim of overzealous prosecution; the number of court filings 1s not a good
indicator because the amount is affected by a lot of reasons.” Ironically, he said that prior

appeared before the Committee during her tenure .and leadership did not seem to affect the outcome of their
evaluation -— “The persons on the Committee are a tenacious bunch and would not let PCPAO favoritism go by. ”

<hr>

54 Archer added that she could not recall the Committee 3 discussions of Robnett anyway because it was early 1n her
tenure on the Committee




Prosecutors expected DPAs to try a lot of cases and rewarded them for it — a “trial warrior”
culture, as Lindquist described it. In contrast, Penner said that Lindquist emphasized resolving
cases; “He is not really focused on prosecuting cases; he is a politician, 
so his main concern from
a prosecutorial perspective involves <mark>media cases that could affect the perception of the office and
him</mark>.” Other DPAs, including those in leadership, agreed with Penner’s assessment; one said that
Lindquist was known as “Misdemeanor Mark” when he was in the SAU, z'. e. , he would plea
felonies to misdemeanor and try only the “sure wins.” In sum, as a general matter, no DPAs
interviewed agreed that the PCPAO engaged in overzealous prosecution.

The Merrival Complaint identified the _Daising_ case and the Tacoma Hilltop Crips Gang
Cases as examples of Lindquist’s vindictive and overzealous prosecutions respectively.
Regarding Dalsing, <mark>Pierce County Superior Court Judge Edmund Murphy, a former DPA, has
already ruled that the PCPAO engaged in vindictive prosecution by re-filing charges against
Dalsing</mark> without new evidence to support them. I have not engaged in additional fact-finding
regarding Dalsing in an effort to avoid second-guessing a Superior Court judge who carefully
reviewed all the evidence. However, I will offer the comments of one senior leader about the
Dalsing prosecution. S/he was confident that no one in the PCPAO would file charges against
anyone, including Dalsing, without probable cause. That is not to say that prosecutorial
discretion was exercised wisely, the senior leader said. His/her admonition was, “If law
enforcement doesn’t bring the case, then you shouldn’t pursue it,“ 216., if the PCSD doesn’t
believe there is enough evidence to bring the case, then the PCPAO shouldn’t file charges.

Nor did any witness I interviewed agree with Merrival’s claim that “In March of 2010,
Lindquist initiated a gigantic criminal prosecution, with perhaps the primary purpose of
obtaining publicity himself, against 32 black defendants alleged to belong to the so called Hilltop
gang using a singular conspiratorial argument.” Asst. Criminal Division Chief and head of the
Gang Team (Team X) Greg Greer said that the theory of the prosecution was, “If you join a
gang, you join an on-going conspiracy to commit a crime,” which would support a conspiracy
conviction without getting a conviction for an individual act. He said he heard about the novel
theory at a conference and learned that it had been used in Florida and New York. Greer stated
that Judge Felnagle concluded after months of procedural wrangling that the broad theory was
too big and required them to charge the defendants individually with a specific conspiracy.

Greer added that once the cases were severed, the defense attorneys began looking at the
underlying charges against the individual defendants. In the Raphael Justice case cited
specifically by Merrival, Greer said that the defendant's conduct justified only an assault plea.
Greer emphasized that from a prosecutorial standpoint the cases were very successful: 4,014
total months imposed on 36 defendants; an average sentence of 112 months; and, an average
sentence of 276 months for the defendants who went to trial. He claimed that the case decimated
the gang; violent gang crime in the Hilltop area is non-existent by comparison; crimes are
committed by gang members acting individually, rather than as a gang; and, based on feedback
from Dept. of Corrections, gang members are now terrified that membership in the gang is
enough to get them convicted of a crime. Finally, Greer said that neither the theory of the case
nor his reason for bringing it were politically or racially motivated, although Lindquist has
enjoyed the success of it for his and the office’s advantage.

Both Judge Sorenson and DPA James Curtis echoed Greer’s sentiments. Sorenson
explained that most of the defendants pled guilty to a conspiracy charge (over 20); almost all of
the charges were convicted; and, all defendants were charged with crimes of violence, not drug
crimes. He said that he was absolutely satisfied with the conspiracy charge, which was initially
charged as a global consPiracy and then “hacked up“ into smaller conspiracies as the evidence
developed. He added that the conspiracy charges were legally motivated, not politically
motivated, and created the best legal tool to charge this investigation. In addition, all defendants
were arrested at the same time, which was an effective way to marshal the resources of the
PCPAO and the court.

DPA Curtis said that he was not on the Gang Team at the time the office brought the
case, but he was familiar with the cases and the community. He pointed out that all of the
defendants either pled guilty or were convicted; the case was not a publicity stunt - people were
harmed by the defendants“ crimes; and, the case was Greer’s case, not Lindquist’s. Curtis said
that a person could disagree with the global conspiracy charge, but the allegation that it was
done for publicity is “ridiculous.” He added that he grew up with one of the defendants, Mike
White, who pled guilty to a significant amount of time; Curtis said White’s family gave him
hugs afterwards.

I find that Greer initiated the Hilltop Gang cases; the office did not file the charges for the
purposes of gaining publicity for Lindquist or the PCPAO; the cases were not brought for racial
or political reasons.

Finally, the Penner Complaint alleged that after the Dalsing criminal case was dismissed
for vindictive prosecution, civil DPAs were involved in discussions regarding whether to move
for reconsideration or to appeal. The Penner Complaint further alleged that Penner raised
concerns during the conversation about Civil Division Chief Doug Vanscoy’s “initial“ proposal
to “appeal and seek settlement of the civil sui .” Penner said he was uncomfortable with the
recommendation because a decision about the criminal matter should not be based on its impact
on the County’s civil litigation with Dalsing. Penner added that his impression was that Vanscoy
did not understand the ethical implications of his advice.

In a letter submitted as a part of Lindquist’s and Farina’s preliminary response to the
WSBA’s disciplinary counsel, Vanscoy said, “[T]he claim that I recommended an appeal of the
criminal dismissal as leverage to settle the civil suit is totally false.” When asked why the Civil
Division was involved in a conversation about a criminal case, Lindquist said that Vanscoy is
very smart and reasonable and Lindquist wanted him (and Proctor) at the table to contribute to
the dialogue. He recalled that Vanscoy said they should appeal the dismissal of the Dalsing
criminal case, but did not say that the office should settle her civil case.

Sheeran said that he came into the conversation about the vindictive prosecution finding
after it started. He stated that he was not sure why the Civil Division participated in the
conversation about the dismissal of a criminal matter, but it was not typical. Sheeran also noted
that it was not typical that a criminal defendant (Dalsing) was also suing the County civilly.
Importantly, he recalled that at a later meeting “some DPA connected the two cases,” the civil
and the criminal cases, but the criminal DPAs were adamant that they were not going to do it.
The criminal DPAs’ only concern was whether Dalsing was criminally culpable.

I find that Lindquist involved Civil Division employees in the conversation among senior
leaders about whether to appeal or seek reconsideration of the vindictive prosecution dismissal of
the Dalsing criminal case. I further find that civil DPAS connected appeal of the criminal matter
with settlement of the civil case, but that criminal DPAS rejected the connection. I am unable to
determine from the evidence whether Vanscoy was the civil DPA who made the suggestion.

B. Prosecutorial Misconduct

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint contained a table of cases brought by the PCPAO
where convictions were secured in the trial court only to be reversed on appeal.55 The Complaint
suggested that the PCPAO was “Top in Prosecutorial Misconduct Reversals.”

Summary of the Factual Findings: DPA witnesses uniformly believed that the reasons for
the prosecutorial misconduct rulings by the appellate courts are complex and are not due to
overly zealous or vindictive prosecution encouraged by Lindquist or his leadership. The best
evidence of the reasons for the rulings is found in the courts“ rulings.

Summgy of the Evidence: Both leadership and DPA witnesses took great pains to
explain that “prosecutorial misconduct” is a term of art that simply means error on a DPA’s part.
No one placed the blame for any increase in the number of reversals on Lindquist or his
administration, pointing out that the reversals often arise out of closing arguments, which
represent choices made by individual DPAs during trial. And, no witness attributed these results
to a pattern of overly-aggressive or vindictive prosecution.

The explanations offered by the witnesses for the office’s prosecutorial misconduct
reversals included the following.

I The appellate courts are more frequently deciding prosecutorial misconduct cases
now and giving more credence to misconduct allegations.

I Much of the conduct that has been reversed has been accepted for a long period of
time; and, when one case is reversed. a long string of cases involving the same type of conduct or

55 Witnesses pointed out some inaccuracies in the table of cases, ta, it included cases that preceded the Lindquist
administration; and, in one instance, a listed case was out of Thurston County and not tried by the listed DPA.
form of argument are overturned, a. 3., cases involving the use of PowerPoint in closing argument
were overturned when one ruling made new law or clarified existing law.

I According to Judge Sorenson, the four pages of prosecutorial misconduct cases
attached to the Merrival Complaint indicate an office dealing with a lot of crime and serious
cases. One witness said that the PCPAO prosecutes more felonies and misdemeanors than the
AG’s office or King County. So, many cases end up in front of Division II and the risk of a
negative ruling is higher.

Witnesses said that continuing legal education classes on the appellate rulings are put on
by various providers, including WAPA. In addition, the PCPAO leadership in both the Civil and
Criminal Divisions emailed DPAs about the cases and their recommendations for responding to
them. Tom Roberts of the Civil Division also presented two CLEs for DPAs entitled, “How to
Prevent Prosecutorial Misconduct in Closing Argument,” in May/June 2013. Attendance was
mandatory for criminal DPAs and Farina took attendance. Roberts” opinion of the prosecutorial
misconduct case law after 30 years in the PCPAO was that the courts are no longer taking a
laissez faire approach to the issue. He said that the attitude of the appellate courts has changed
and they are now taking a more strict approach. He noted that formerly a prosecutor would have
to “go off the deep en “ for a defendant to be granted a new trial; now, prosecutors are held to a
very high standard. Roberts said the rules are changing, “but that is how the law develops.”

I did not conduct the empirical research necessary to opine on whether the number of
cases of prosecutorial misconduct cases coming out of the PCPAO is rising, or how they
compare against other jurisdictions. However, I can confidently state that DPAs throughout the
PCPAO believe that the reasons for the rulings are complex and are not due to overly zealous or
vindictive prosecution encouraged by Lindquist or his leadership.

IV. Gross Waste of Public Funds

A. Exorbitant External and Internal Defense Expenditures Protecting Self-Interests

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that the PCPAO has spent “likely in excess
of a million dollars“ in DPA time and outside counsel fees related to defending Lindquist’s
actions. The Penner Complaint elaborated that three recent lawsuits filed against the County
claimed personal misconduct by Lindquist: Dalsfng (alleging malicious prosecution by the
PCPAO); Nissan (public records lawsuit seeking copies of Lindquist’s personal cell phone
records); and, Ames (alleging that Lindquist wrongfully identified him as a PIE officer). The
Penner Complaint alleged that the PCPAO hired Phil Talmadge to represent its interests and
Stewart Estes to represent Lindquist. The Complaint further stated that “the majority of the
briefing was conducted in—house, by senior DPAs during work hours.” The Penner Complaint
also alleged that the briefs included an amicus brief to the Washington Supreme Court in the
Nissan case to be filed by outside parties, including various labor organizations and the Guild.
The brief was intended to complement a brief filed by the County in the case.

Summgy of the Factual Findings: A committee of senior leaders of the PCPAO rewrote
briefs in both the Nissan and Ames matters; the value of the time spent by senior leaders, which
was extensive, is unknown; the County hired Phil Talmadge and Lindquist retained Stewart Estes
to represent them in the Nissan matter; the committee of senior leaders also reworked an amicus
brief in the Nissan litigation that the Guild and other labor unions agreed to sign.

Summgy of the Evidence: Penner said that every appellate brief in the Nissan litigation,
including the amicus brief filed by the Guild and other unions, and all the briefing in the Arnas
litigation was done by a committee consisting at various time the following senior leaders of the
PCPAO — Lindquist, Penner, Farina, Sheeran, Civil Division Chief Doug Vanscoy, Dan
Hamilton, the lead Civil Division attorney on the Nissan case, and Mike Sommerfeld, the DPA
advisor to the PCSD. He said the group drafted the briefs over a few days, with the brief
displayed on the screen and everyone giving their comments. Penner said that his concerns with
the process included: It was a conflict of interest for PCPAO management to draft an amicus
brief for the Guild, a labor organization, to sign in order to protect Lindquist’s cell phone
records; it was a waste of time writing by committee and involving criminal attorneys in drafting
civil briefs; and, outside firms were responsible for the litigation, so the briefing should not have
been done in—house.

Hamilton explained that the first Nissan case (“Nissen I”) went up to the
Washington Supreme Court. He said that he handled the case through the Court of
Appeals and the PCPAO hired outside counsel when it went to the Supreme Court.
Hamilton said that the office assembled briefing sessions to rework some of his work
product, as well the briefs drafted by outside counsel. He further explained that the
plaintiffs filed “the same claims" later in a case that has been referred to as “Nissen II.”
The PCPAO also hired outside counsel to represent the County in Nissan 11 and the in—
house briefing sessions repeated themselves in that matter, too. He said that the Civil
Division and senior leaders were not satisfied with the work product they received from
outside counsel and spent time re-working the briefs.

Hamilton further explained that the office had similar issues with the work
product of outside counsel in Amas as it had in Nissan. So, senior leaders worked
together to redraft briefs in that matter, too. Neither Penner nor Hamilton recalled
“briefing by committee” in Daising, where outside counsel was brought in when it
appeared that DPA Jim Richmond might become a witness.

It is undisputed that Phil Talmadge represents the County and Stewart Estes represents
Lindquist in the Nissan matter. Finally, the County has spent the following amounts to date on
the Nissan, Dalsing and Amas matters: Nissan 1 and II ($530,901.20); Dalsing ($205,418.11);
and Arnas ($240,573.73).

B. Rewarding Loyalty with Titles and Pay

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that the PCPAO has created more positions
with titles and pay and given them to less experienced deputies than previous administrations.

Summary of the Factual Findings: The PCPAO has created more positions in leadership
than previous administrations, as explained below. I do not have the information necessary to
determine if the individuals given those positions are less experienced.

Summgy of the Evidence: It is undisputed that the Lindquist administration has created
leadership positions and titles that did not exist under previous Prosecutors. Generally speaking,

Lindquist said that he wants people to feel reSponsible for their team and how it’s performing so,
if the Division is large, he will break it up to create that sense of responsibility within the team.
Other former DPAs said Lindquist’s motives were more cynical. One recalled Lindquist saying:
“you give people titles; it doesn’t cost anything and it makes them feel good.” Another said his

general philosophy was that persons in management positions were closer to him and had more
allegiance to him.

I do not reach a finding regarding Lindquist’s motives for establishing the new positions
and titles because I have no evidence that he exceeded his authority as Prosecutor in creating
them. Nor will I judge the experience and qualifications of those appointed to the positions
because I think it would do them a disservice. I do find, however, that Lindquist added the
positions identified below for the reasons stated.

I Homicide Division and Felony Division: Penner said that the Criminal Division
of the PCPAO used to have 6 trial teams managed by a Chief Criminal Deputy and Asst. Chief

Criminal Deputy. When Robnett resigned, Lindquist filled those positions and also created a
Felony Division Chief. Farina noted that the PCPAO is an office of .220 employees, which
became too big a load for Robnett, so Lindquist added a Felony Division Chief after she left.
Then, as noted, Lindquist set up a homicide team, turned it into a Division and appointed Blinn
as the Homicide Chief. As Division Chiefs, rather than Team Chiefs, the positions were not a
part of the Guild bargaining unit and the incumbents lost the protection of the labor agreement.

I Gang Team and Elder Abuse Unit. Greer said that gang cases used to be included
in Team 1 (Robbery and Assaults). Lindquist said that he created the Gang Team to place

emphasis on those cases and to make sure someone was taking responsibility for them. Greer
echoed Lindquist’s rationale; he said he wanted to focus on gang cases, which became more
significant when he filed the Hilltop Gang case. The unit was created when he needed help after
the court severed the conspiracy cases. Lindquist said that the Elder Abuse Unit (includes both
fraud and abuse) was modeled after the gang unit, which was also a one-DPA unit in the
beginning. He said that separating elder-related work from the fraud unit was intended to build
expertise and relationships in the elder community necessary to prosecute the cases successiiilly-
Lindquist said he also wanted to communicate to the public that the cases were important.


I Assistant Team Chiefs. These are also new positions under Lindquist. He said
that the addition of the positions in the larger teams put someone in a position of authority when
the Team Chief was in trial or absent. He said that the Assistant Team Chiefs feel more
responsibility for the success of the team and begin to develop leadership skills. Other DPAs
were not so sanguine. One said that the incumbents get status and a reduced work load; another
noted that the Assistant now is the charging DPA, giving the Team Chief complete freedom,
which might be necessary because Lindquist occupies so much of their time in conferences.

V. Retaliation

The Merrival and Penner Complaints alleged that Lindquist has reassigned or threaten to
reassign the following DPAs and others for criticizing him too loudly or publicly.

A. Jim Schacht

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that Lindquist assigned DPA Jim Schacht to
the Appeals Division when he questioned the directive about the Ames declarants. The Penner
Complaint alleged that he was moved to Appeals “after speaking out against Lindquist.”

Summm of the Factual Findings: Schacht’s candid conversation with Lindquist that was
critical in some respects of his administration was a motivating factor in Lindquist’s decision to
transfer him to Appeals.

Summgy of the Evidence: By all accounts, Schacht is a very good trial lawyer. He has
worked at the PCPAO since 1990. Schacht said that he was transferred in 2012 to Team 1
(Robber/Assault) to handle pre-assigned Class A felonies after a stint in the federal prosecutor’s
office. He said that the position was a good assignment for him. In May 2014, the office had a
number of openings, including the Chief Criminal Deputy and Homicide Chief positions.
Schacht said that he and Lindquist had a couple of two-hour conversations about the openings
and Lindquist asked his opinion about who should fill them. Schacht was aware that a lot of
people supported his assignment to Homicide Chief, so he told Lindquist, “If you are considering
me, then we have to have a conversation about how you are handling the office. I shouldn’t be
in the position if there are no changes.” Schacht told Lindquist that the office was much too
political and promotions were made on the basis of political support rather than good work, and
Schacht said he was not willing to be party to it. Schacht further stated that respect for the
incumbent Prosecutor among sheriffs and junior prosecutors was important and those ranks were
slim. Finally, Schacht said he told Lindquist that he was perfectly happy in his current position
in Team 1.

Two weeks later, Penner went to Schacht and told him that he was being moved to the
Appeals unit. When Schacht asked for an explanation, Penner said that persons in the ofiice
moved from time to time. From Schacht’s perspective, the reason appeared to be Schacht’s deep

disagreements with how Lindquist ran the PCPAO. One Team Chief said that he asked Schacht
one morning, “Appeals?” Later, Schacht said to him, “Heaven forbid you have an opinion
contrary to the elected boss” opinion and you voice that opinion.” Schacht said that Bryce
Nelson, Lindquist‘s campaign Treasurer, replaced him on Team 1 doing Class A felonies. The
filing period for Lindquist’s election ended in early May 2014. At the end of the filing week in
mid-May, no one filed against Lindquist so all election activity stopped. The office announced
Nelson’s new assignment soon afterwards.

Lindquist denied that Schacht said in their conversation the office was too political. He
recalled speaking to Schacht about the open leadership positions and Schacht mentioned his
disagreements with some transfers and promotions. Lindquist said that Schacht thought that the
most important criteria in assignments was being a good trial attorney; being a good colleague
and emissary was less important. Lindquist noted that Schacht had been in Team 1 awhile,
Appeals was a good learning ground and the office was looking for someone to replace DPA
Kawyne Lund. He said that Schacht’s transfer was not in response to what Schacht said — he
already knew Schacht’s philosophy before the meeting. Finally, regarding Nelson, Lindquist said
that Sheeran had been telling Lindquist that Nelson needed to try Class A felonies and the
transfer was intended to cultivate the career of a young trial attorney and give him a chance to try
big cases.

Sheeran echoed Lindquist’s explanation for Schacht’s move. In addition, when asked, he
said that Schacht is not “warm and fuzzyf’ Schacht is also not a “Lindquist fan” and has
expressed a lack of appreciation for him; and, Lindquist has said something along the lines of a
“bull in a china shop” when describing Schacht. Pat Cooper, Chief of Team 1, said that Schacht
was doing a very good job for him. When it came to Cooper's attention that leadership was
thinking of re—assigning Schacht, he told one of the senior staff that Schacht was doing a great
job and there was no need to move him. Cooper said he was not involved in the decision to
move Schacht, but later Lindquist told Cooper that he transferred Nelson into the position
because Nelson is someone they wanted to move into a leadership position.

I find that <mark>Schacht’s critical conversation with Lindquist about his administration was a
motivating factor in Lindquist’s decision to transfer him to Appeals.</mark> First, Schacht was
uniformly praised by witnesses as a trial lawyer. He is not an appellate lawyer and DPAs,
including Team Chiefs, said that his transfer to the Appeals Division did not make sense to them.
Second, both Schacht and his Team Chief told Lindquist and senior leaders that Schacht liked
where he was working and there was no need to move him. Granted DPA Lund wanted
desperately to move out of Appeals and Lindquist wanted to give Nelson, his campaign treasurer,
a position that would enable him to move into leadership. However, the timing of Schacht’s
transfer shortly after his candid conversation with Lindquist suggests that Schacht was the DPA
Lindquist chose to address these two needs because Schacht criticized Lindquist and the way he
ran the PCPAO.<sup>56</sup>

<hr>

<sup>56</sup> As noted, Lindquist was aware that Schacht was not a “fan” of his and criticized him to other DPAs, which had
gotten Schacht crosswise with Lindquist before. Schacht’s history with Lindquist probably played a part in the
decision, too.

**B. Diane Clarkson**

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that DP Diane Clarkson was reassigned
when she spoke out in support of the Minority Bar Association and chose to associate with the
Ames declarants. The Penner Complaint explained that Clarkson “spoke out” by opposing

Lindquist’s proposed change in the law intended to help support the application of DPA Kevin
McCann for a vacancy on the District Court Bench.

Summary of the Factual Findings: <mark>Lindquist transferred Clarkson to Remann Hall, a
known destination for persons out of favor with Lindquist, to punish her for her opposition to his
proposal to the County Council to replace the Minority Bar Association with the PCPAO on an
_ad hoc_ committee to evaluate candidates for judicial appointment.</mark> In addition, Lindquist
attempted to ingratiate himself with Clarkson after Merrival and Penner filed their Complaints by
telling her that he made a mistake to transfer her and asking her where she saw herself in the
office.

Summgy of the Evidence: Lindquist recalled that the County Council was proposing to
create a committee to make recommendations to them to fill a District Court seat that Kevin
McCann was interested in. He explained that there had been a committee previously and the
PCPAO did not have a seat on it. Lindquist said he told a Council member that he wanted to
have the PCPAO at the table on the new committee. The proposal made by a Council member
included the PCPAO but not the Minority Bar Association. Lindquist stated that he got calls
from the community to support adding the Minority Bar Association to the connnittee, so later in
the process he advocated adding it. He thought that Clarkson believed that only one of the two
organizations could be at the table and spoke at the Council meeting advocating that the Minority
Bar Association keep its seat at the expense of the PCPAO.

Clarkson said that Lindquist called her into his office around December 2013 (the
Council appointed McCann in July 2013). He said he heard that Clarkson told others he did not
like her. Lindquist assured her, “I want you to know that I do like you, but I don"t like what you
did at the Council meeting.” Clarkson said Lindquist went on and on to assure her that he had
nothing to do with the proposed changes to the Council’s ad hoc committee. He said that all he
did was speak to the Council about having the PCPAO represented on the committee; the
Council must have assumed that he wanted the Minority Bar removed. Clarkson said his
comments did not make any sense to her because she knew from Council members that
Lindquist had told them that the Council should not give credence to the input of the Minority
Bar and Lindquist was proposing a completely different makeup of the committee. Clarkson
said that she took off time from work to speak to the Council as the Past President of the
Minority Bar Association about the importance of keeping it on the committee.

In July 2014, Clarkson said she was transferred to the Juvenile Division at Remann
Hall,” a few weeks after Sheeran stared at her in the pit for socializing with Ames declarant
Bryan Hershmansg. Sheeran went to Clarkson’s office: “How do you like working with Kevin
Benton?” Clarkson responded: “I love working with him; he is a great guy and we worked
together in District Court.” Sheeran replied: “Good, because you are going to Remann Hall.”

Clarkson asked if she had any say in the matter, to which Sheeran replied: “No, it is a done
deal.”

Clarkson’s Team Chief at the time, Pat Cooper, said that Lindquist was concerned about
the opinion Clarkson expressed regarding the District Court judicial endorsement process. He
said that Clarkson was a pre—trial negotiator for his team and doing a great job — she was a very
good attorney. Lindquist Spoke to Cooper the day he transferred Clarkson to Remann Hall and
said he understood Clarkson enjoyed working there and wanted to go back. Cooper knew that
Clarkson liked where she was and expressed concern about the transfer, asking “have you talked
to her?” Lindquist said he had not spoken to her.

Lindquist said that the decision to transfer Clarkson to Remann Hall was Sheeran’s,
possibly with some involvement by Farina. He said that Clarkson was the only person suggested
to him by Sheeran; Clarkson had worked at Remann Hall and they thought she would be a good
fit. He said that the transfer was motivated by a desire to give DPA Brian Leech a shot on a trial
team, so the question was who to replace him with. Sheeran said that the decision was, in fact,
Lindquist’s and explained that Leech- had gotten sideways years ago with Robnctt, had been at
Remann Hall for many years and needed a chance to rehabilitate his career.

Robnett recalled that Lindquist told her that he did not like what Clarkson did by
Speaking to the Council. Judge Sorenson added that Lindquist is a big supporter of dissent, so
long as (1) you do it to his face; and (2) you support him once he makes a decision in the matter.
He said that Clarkson violated rule #1 by addressing the Council. Lastly, Hilligoss described a
conversation with Sheeran. She asked him, “Were you at the table when Diane Clarkson’s move
to Remann Hall was discussed?” She said Sheeran answered: “Yes, <mark>she was moved because she
spoke out against Mark.</mark>” He explained that Clarkson spoke out against Lindquist in support of
the Minority Bar Association.

Finally, Clarkson said that on Monday, June 1, 2015, after the filing of both
whistleblower complaints, Lindquist arranged a meeting with her through her Team Chief, Kevin
Benton. Lindquist told Clarkson that he recalled she gave him sound advice early in his
administration that he could not hear or see it at the time. When Clarkson asked Lindquist
whether he was apologizing, he responded, “Yes.” He admitted that his administration had

<hr> 

5’7 Remann Hall is geographically isolated from the County/City building. As noted, it is widely known as the
transfer destination of persons perceived as malcontents by Lindquist and his senior leaders. PCPAO HR Manager
Lisa Hilligoss said that an attorney from the AG’s office asked her: “Why do you send your derelicts out to Remann
Hall? Everyone knows it.”

53 Clarkson and Hershman, an Ame-s declarant, both said that they were talking one day in the pit and they saw
Sheeran glaring at them. Sheeran denied it.


treated her badly, her transfer to Remann Hall was not a wise use of her skills and the transfer
was his mistake. He then asked her where Clarkson saw herself in the office. When Clarkson
asked how she went hem rags to riches, Lindquist responded, “Well, I am wiser; I didn’t
understand before.“ Clarkson concluded that the offer was “absolutely a bribe; Lindquist doesn’t
give favors for nothing.”

I find that Lindquist attempted to assist McCann’s appointment by changing the process
for advising the County Council about judicial candidates. Lindquist admitted to Clarkson and
told senior leaders that Clarkson upset him by opposing his plan to replace the Minority Bar
Association with the PCPAO on the committee. I further find <mark>Lindquist transferred Clarkson to
Remann Hall, a known destination of persons out of favor with Lindquist, to punish her for her
opposition. Finally, Lindquist attempted to curry favor with Clarkson after Merrival and Penner
filed their Complaints by telling her that he made a mistake to transfer her and asking her where
she saw herself in the office.</mark>

C. Brian Leech

Allegation: The Penner Complaint alleged that Lindquist proposed moving DPA Brian
Leech from the felony property crime team to Remann Hall after Leech spoke out against the
proposed amicus brief in Nissan v. Pierce County.

Summgy of the Factual Findings: <mark>Lindquist proposed moving DPA Brian Leech from
Team 3 (Property Crimes/Animal Cruelty) to Remann Hall after Leech spoke out at a Guild
meeting against approving the proposed _Nissen_ amicus brief. In addition, on the same day that
Lindquist met with Clarkson to apologize for transferring her (after the Complaints were filed),
Farina met with Leech and asked him where he wanted to be in the office and whether he had
any interest in being a judge.</mark>

Summgy of the Evidence: The incident alluded to by Penner was discussed previously.
To reiterate briefly, Leech commented at a Guild meeting that the Nissan amicus brief was not
accurate and the Guild needed more time to consider it; DPAs who supported the brief and
Lindquist became upset with Leech because of his opposition; according to Penner, the following
Monday, Lindquist called him into his office and asked, “What is wrong with Brian Leech [for
arguing against the brief] ?” Lindquist told Penner, “Talk to Dawn about moving him back to
Remann Hall.”

Penner said he did not speak with Leech about Lindquist’s response to Leech's
opposition to the amicus brief in his capacity as a senior leader, but he told him as a friend.

Leech recalled that Penner spoke to him about Lindquist’s comments, including a statement by
Lindquist that Leech was “not working out in Team 3.”

Penner also recalled Lindquist telling him that Leech declined to greet Ausserer one time,
and did not respond to a hello from DPA Ruyf when Lindquist and Ruyf were coming back from
court. Lindquist told Penner to speak to Leech, to tell him that it was unprofessional not to greet
someone, and to let him know it was noticed. Penner said he spoke to Leech later and told him,
“Here’s what I am supposed to tell you. . . 3’59 Afterwards, when asked, Penner told Lindquist
that he spoke with Leech and told him that he failed to greet his coworkers, including Lindquist,
and he should respond as a professional. Penner said Lindquist replied, <mark>"Don’t bring up my
name; I don’t want my name involved in this."</mark> '50

Lindquist said that he heard about a kerfuffle involving the amicus brief at a Guild
meeting; he only later heard Leech’s name attached to opposition to the brief; he did not discuss
sending Leech back to Remann Hall; and, he recalled a conversation about Leech not greeting
people, including himself, and saying he didn’t want to be dragged into any conversation about
it. One senior leader said that Leech’s attendance at the Dalsing vindictive prosecution hearing
came up at a leadership meeting; Ausserer said that Leech walked by him without smiling,
seeming to side with Dalsing; Farina became very upset and discussed whether Leech could be
fired for it. Ausserer said he shared his experience when the group discussed Leech not
addressing Lindquist and Ruyf in the elevator, but said he did not hear any conversation about
firing Leech.

On the basis of this evidence, I find that the allegation in the Penner Complaint is true,
ta, <mark>Lindquist proposed moving DPA Brian Leech from Team 3 to Remann Hall after Leech
spoke out against the proposed amicus brief.</mark> Key to this finding is Leech’s recollection that
Penner told him at the time that Lindquist said Leech was “not working out in Team 3.” Penner
contemporaneously recounting the conversation to Leech is more trustworthy than Lindquist’s
later denial of it. I cannot confirm, however, that senior leaders discussed firing Leech for not
greeting senior leaders with a “hello” because recollection of the conversation was equivocal.

One other conversation involving Leech is worth mentioning here. <mark>On the same day that
Lindquist apologized to Clarkson after the whistleblower complaints had been filed, Farina sent
Leech an email “out of the blue” suggesting they have coffee and catch up. When they met,
Leech said Farina told him she has always liked him and he was doing a great job. Then, Farina
asked Leech, “Where do you want to be in the office?” She also asked Leech if he had any
interest in being a judge, the first time Farina had discussed the subject with him. Farina said her
decision to meet with Leech was her idea and not connected to Lindquist’s plan to meet with
Clarkson. She had read Merrival’s Complaint but claimed she just wanted to catch up with
Leech and check in with him about his work on animal abuse cases.</mark>

More recently, <mark>Lindquist made a call to his former Chief Criminal Deputy, Mary Robnett,
that followed a similar pattern. Robnett said Lindquist called her on the day that I interviewed
her, after she had not heard from him for a few years. He started by saying that she had always
been one of the most important people in his life; he valued her opinion; and, if she asked him
for a favor, he would do it for her. He then told Robnett that he loved her when she left the
office and still does. Lastly, he said, “I need a favor from you; I need your counsel and would
like to meet you.”</mark> Robnett was heading into a three week trial and told Lindquist she was not
inclined to meet with him. Lindquist generally confirmed the gist of the conversation described
by Robnett.

A former PCPAO colleague of Robnett’s told her that Lindquist was in damage control
mode and either wanted to neutralize her or enlist her help. I find that Lindquist’s and <mark>Farinais
outreach to Clarkson, Leech and Robnett were all attempts to neutralize them and to control the
damage done by the Merrival and Penner Complaints.</mark> The finding is based on the status of
Clarkson, Leech and Robnett — all persons of some influence61 who Lindquist had ostracized in
some way; the content of the outreach — both complimentary and solicitous; and, the timing of
the contacts — after the Complaints.

<hr>

59 Leech told Penner that he didn’t hear either hello and did not intend to snub anyone.

5” Penner understood that Lindquist wanted the message to come from Penner, not from him, which Penner
described as, “plausible deniability in a very unimportant situation.”



D. Detective Glenda Nissen

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that Lindquist and the PCPAO retaliated
against Nissen by interfering with her investigations, limiting her access to DPA support and
limiting her case filings.

Summm of the Factual Findings: The PCPAO requested in early 2015 that the PCSD
remove Nissen from her appointment as the detective assigned to the SAU; when the PCSD
refused, the PCPAO attempted to place substantial limitations on the interactions between her
and the SAU DPAs and interviewers; <mark>the limitations were unlike any previously placed on a
police officer working with the PCPAO; and, the PCPAO placed the limitations on interactions
with Nissen because she had filed numerous lawsuits and complaints against the office, which
was the first time the PCPAO had to face this situation.</mark>

Summgy of the Evidence: The PCSD designated Nissen as the detective assigned to
work with the PCPAO’s SAU in March 2015. Undersheriff Rob Masko said the Department
appointed Nissen because she applied for the position with the encouragement of her supervisors.
Upon learning of the appointment, Asst. Chief of the PCPAO’s Civil Division, Denise Greer,
called and asked Masko to reconsider Nissan’s appointment. Masko told Greer that he would not
“monkey around with the process”: Nissen was ethical and did good work; and, his only concern
was whether she could keep up with the caseload (she tended to focus on a couple of cases).
Greer was very disappointed, according to Masko, and made the same request two weeks later.
When Masko declined again, Greer said that the office couldn’t charge her cases. His response
was, “she is working the cases and you will need someone to testify.”

<hr>

51 Clarkson and Leech are both active politically in minority communities and Robnett is a well-respected trial
lawyer in the community.

Asst. Team Chief of SAU, Heather DeMaine, said that she was charging cases solo in
early 2015 because DPA Angelica Williams was on leave. DeMaine said she attended a meeting
with the unit’s forensic interviewers on March 25, 2015 led by Denise Greer. DeMaine
explained that the interviewers typically interview a child victim while the assigned detective
watches through a two-way mirror. The detective takes notes of the interview and then meets
with the interviewer at the end to discuss whether any follow-up is necessary. The interviewer
provides a summary of the interview to the charging DPA, who sometimes watches a tape of the
interview. DeMaine said that in 12 years in the SAU, she has never been asked to attend a
forensic interview.

At the meeting, Greer told DeMaine and the interviewers that Nissen was coming into the
unit as a detective and they were not to have any in—person contact with her, including by
telephone. If they needed to speak with her, then they should have someone else with them.
Greer said they could email Nissen, but only after Greer or Civil Division Chief Doug Vanscoy
reviewed the email. Greer also told DeMaine that she was going to have to attend any forensic
interview that Nissen attended to watch her interaction with the interviewers. Further, <mark>DeMaine
was not to speak with Nissen, despite the fact that they would be the only two persons in the
room watching the interview. Greer told them that the precautions were necessary because
Nissen could not be trusted and she could put words in the interviewer’s mouth. When DeMaine
asked, “What if she asks why I am watching her and not other detectives, Greer responded,
“Don’t answer the question. We don't want her to know — we don’t want you to tip her off.”</mark>

Greer also told DeMaine that she was supposed to treat her cases as if Nissen’s aspect of
her investigation didn’t happen; Nissen was on the PIE list and DeMaine had to assume that she
could not call Nissen as a witness. Greer instructed the interviewers, who work hand-in—hand
with the detectives, not to ride with Nissen to a school interview and not to talk to her unless
DeMaine was present.

<mark>DeMaine said that she and the interviewers were very upset and concerned that the
restrictions would put their cases and the child victims at risk.</mark> It seemed to DeMaine that the
office was retaliating against Nissen to make her ineffective so that the Sheriff‘s Office would
take her off SAU cases. DeMaine also said that <mark>the protocols were an unprecedented approach
to a detective with PIE information. She called Sheeran that night very upset. She told him
about the meeting, her concerns about treating Nissen differently, the requirement that she attend
interviews for the first time and not to assist Nissen, all to the detriment of their cases.</mark> When
DeMaine told Sheeran she was not going to do it, Sheeran responded, “When you are in a
position of leadership, sometimes you’re asked to do things that make you uncomfortable.”

After two weeks of back and forth between DeMaine and senior leaders, including
Sheeran and Ausserer, DeMaine and the interviewers met with Greer again on April 14, 2015.
Greer told DeMaine that she didn’t have to attend forensic interviews, but they were not to have
cne—on—one contact with Nissen without a witness; they could email her, but only with approval
from Farina, Vanscoy or Greer, unless the email was about procedure only; if Nissen contacted
them by telephone, they were to document the conversation verbatim, mark it “attorney-client
privilege” and route it to Denise Greer; and, finally, Greer confirmed that DeMaine and
interviewers should pursue the cases with due diligence regardless of who was assigned.

The interviewers confirmed DeMaine’s recollection of the meetings with Greer and the
limitations placed on their interactions with Nissen. During that time period, the interviewers
said that <mark>they became concerned because it appeared that a child victim’s case would be handled
differently because of the detective assigned.</mark>

Lindquist said that he was “out of the loop on Detective Nissen?” he only knew that the
Civil Division had been giving advice, but he was not aware of the advice being given. He said
that the office’s civil DPAs were involved in advising the SAU “because Nissen has filed more
than 10 complaints against the County.“ Farina explained that the Civil Division gets involved
when “there is a potential for litigation to prevent problems from arising.” Greer said that she,
Farina and Sheeran developed the restrictions. Greer said that she, as a civil DPA, was involved
because Nissen had filed a claim against the County, which had been settled, and there was a
concern that she would allege retaliation. Greer acknowledged that she had been with the office
18 years and the office had never imposed similar restrictions on a police officer, but she said the
office never had an officer sue it before.

I find that the PCPAO requested the PCSD to remove Nissen from her appointment as the
detective assigned to the SAU; when the PCSD refused, the PCPAO attempted to place
substantial limitations on the interactions between the SAU DPAs and interviewers and Nissen;
the limitations were unlike any previously placed on a police officer working with the PCPAO;
and, the PCPAO placed the limitations on interactions with Nissen because she had filed
numerous lawsuits and complaints against the office.

VI. Disregard of Merit Based Employment

Allegation: The Merrival Complaint alleged that Lindquist’s administration has
substituted the merit system of employment with one based on unquestioned loyalty. Those who
are loyal to him are deemed “good colleagues“ and“ receive favorable assignments; conversely,
DPAs who question him are considered “bad colleagues“ and receive disfavored assignments.

Further, Lindquist does not hold loyal DPAs to the same standards as DPAs who are critical or
question his directives.

Summgy of the Factual Findings: DPAs who are loyal to Lindquist are deemed “good
colleagues,“ receive good assignments and are treated differently than those DPAs who fail to
give him, in his opinion, their unequivocal support.

Summgy of the Evidence: In many respects, this allegation goes to the core of the
Merrival and Penner Complaints, as well as the great frustration of some career prosecutors with
the Lindquist administration. Lindquist said that Prosecutor Horne, his predecessor, emphasized
a “trial warrior“ culture and rewarded DPAs who “racked up” a set number of trials in a year
with an annual recognition dinner. When Lindquist was Horne’s campaign manager in 2001, he
said he learned that criminal defense lawyers were upset with Home because they believed that
the PCPAO sought convictions as its primary goal. So, when he took office, Lindquist said that
he attempted to move the office to a “public service culture,” which is reflected in the “trifec ”
used to evaluate applicants and DPAs: “good worker“ (do a good job); “good colleague“ (treat
coworkers respectfully); and, “good emissary” (interact professionally with the public).

As noted previously, only one of these core values (good worker) involve being a good
technical lawyer. The other vaiues emphasize relationships — with coworkers (good colleague)
and the general public (good emissary). Moreover, these relationship values are largely
subjective, much different than an objective measure like the number of trials in a year. The
evidence indicates that Lindquist’s subjective evaluation of a DPA’s relationships with others,
including himself, turn on two principal measures: one’s loyalty to him and his administration;
and, their ability to get along without conflict with others, including himself. Regarding loyalty
to Lindquist, Judge Sorenson, formerly Lindquist’s Chief Criminal Deputy, said it best:
“Lindquist is a big supporter of dissent, so long as you do it to his face and support him once he
makes a decision in the matter.“ Denise Greer, Asst. Chief of the Civil Division, said it this way:
“Mark_doesn’t want people around who make waves; he likes people who everyone gets along
with. PeOple who disagree with him are not sidelined [referring to Asst. Chief Criminal Deputy
Greg Greer, her husband, as an example]; only those who disagree with him in an inappropriate
way.“ Greer also said the being a good colleague is “very important to him; he does not want
people who are unhappy and make others around them unhappy in leadership positions.”

The Merrival Complaint cited Lindquist’s treatment of DPA Brent Hyer as an example of
Lindquist’s disparate treatment of persons loyal to him. In fact, Lindquist’s response to the
conduct of both Brent Hyer and his wife, Team Chief Michelle Hyer, is a good example of the
operation of Lindquist’s trifecta value system. In early March 2014, Sheeran and Hilligoss met
with employees (people in the 955 building) who complained that Brent and Michelle Hyer were
copying library CDs using County equipment onto County CDs. They determined at the
conclusion of an investigation that Brent Hyer used County equipment to copy recipes from a
cookbook and an HBO series, Game of Thrones, using his own discs.152 They further found that
Michelle Hyer was not involved in the copying, but she delegated approval of a legal assistant’s
work hours to her husband when she was out of the office. He used her password to log onto her
computer to approve the time, which gave him access to confidential personnel information.

The investigative interviews revealed serious concerns regarding the conduct of both
Brent and Michelle Hyer. Employees said Michelle Hyer had no “off switch” or “boundaries;”
she sought advice from her husband regularly and often yelled dovm the hall to get it; she
instilled fear in her staff, who “walk on eggshellsf’ and, a couple of times a week spent time at
her son’s school in the morning and arrived at the office between 11:00 am. and noon.

Employees reported that Brent Hyer regularly assisted his wife with cases and spent hours a day
socializing and on his cell phone.

<hr>

'52 Brent Hyer told Sheeran and Hilligoss that he copied 26 out of the series’ 29 disks.

Sheeran said that Brent Hyer claimed his copying was legal and directed Sheeran to the
Fair Use doctrine and Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. , which Sheeran read
to say that Hyer could make copies of copyrighted material for his own use. So, Sheeran told
Hyer “don’t do it again” and said that Hyer “got it.” Afterwards, Hyer was transferred to the
Appeals Division and was promoted to Team Chief of the Fugitive unit (a leadership position but
not a full time one).

Sheeran also said he was involved in the decision to make Michelle Hyer a Team Chief.
She had expressed a strong desire to be a Team leader and had a wealth of experience, but he
said she could be abrasive. So, he “couldn’t put her in charge of 15 peeple” and instead put her
in a small unit to see how she worked out. After the investigation, Sheeran said that he
counseled her how to improve, required her to attend management training classes, and followed
up with team later, who told Sheeran that she was trying to do better but still had issues.

Finally, Farina said that senior leadership gave Michelle Hyer the Team Chief position
“because she really wanted to be a supervisor” and they wanted to give her the Opportunity.
Farina heard that Hyer has been confrontational and “prickly” and Sheeran had counseled her
about those concerns. Notwithstanding those concerns, Farina described Hyer as a good trial
lawyer and a good colleague.

This evidence indicates that Farina and Sheeran gave Michelle Hyer an opportunity to enter
leadership, notwithstanding her known abrasiveness, and addressed the Hyers’ performance
issues and misconduct with verbal counseling and performance management. Contrast the
experience of the Hyers, Lindquist loyalists, with that of Rosie Martinelli, who is perceived as a
Lindquist detractor.63 It is a “tale of two colleagues.“ Martinelli explained that she needed some
relief from a long, regular diet of trial work, so a few years ago she took a position in the Family
Support unit. She said that the work provided her a nice break, but after two years she was ready
to go back to trying cases. She talked to Sheeran in June 2014 about returning to the criminal
division; he seemed positive at flrst but then appeared to make excuses about why she could not
transfer. Consequently, she emailed Farina about status of her request, who resPonded that her
supervisor, Team Chief Sarah Richardson, would speak with her. According to Martinelli,
Richardson said that Farina told her to tell Martinelli that she was not a good colleague or good
emissary; when asked, Farina told Richardson to tell Martinelli that she was “prickly.”

Richardson said that Farina spoke with her about Martinelli’s request. Farina said that
she didn’t want to move Martinelli because of Martinelli’s attitude and demeanor while she was
in the criminal division. Richardson said that she had heard Martinelli had a negative attitude
toward Lindquist and the office and Farina did not want the attitude spread to other parts of the
office. Richardson said that she had not experienced any poor attitude on Martinelli’s part and

<hr>

‘53 Martinelli said that she supported Bertha Fitzer, who ran against Lindquist, and voiced some criticism of her
experience trying a case with Lindquist. She said that she has been ostracized by Lindquist and his “cohort” ever
since.

told Farina that Martinelli had been doing good work in Family Support. Nonetheless, Farina
told Richardsom that she did not intend to move Martinelli into the criminal division because of
the “good colleague” prong of the trifecta. Farina said many people still had that concern, even
though it had not been documented in her recent evaluations. As an aside, Richardson said that
Family Support can be the “stepchild of the office.”

<mark>I find that the different treatment of the Hyers and Martinelli indicates that being a “good
worker” is the lesser of the three prongs of the trifecta.</mark> After all, a “solid” trial lawyer (Farina’s
words} like Martinelli cannot get back to the criminal division, while Michelle Hyer remains a
Team Chief after her struggles as a leader and despite giving her husband access to a confidential
database, and Brent Hyer gets a promotion to Team Chief after using County equipment to copy
a copyright protected HBO series.

I further find that being a good colleague can’t simply mean that must treat your
coworkers with respect, as leadership claims. After all, Martinelli is told that she is “prickly,”
fails the “good colleague” prong of the trifecta and can’t secure a transfer to the criminal
division, despite her “solid” trial skills, her repeated requests, and her good work and good
attitude in Family Support. In contrast, Michelle Hyer is “prickly,” but she is given a Team
Chief role, albeit in a smaller team, because she wants to be a supervisor and the leadership
wants to give her a chance. And, she retained her Team Chief position after her subordinates
identify concerns about her management style.“ Under these circumstances, I conclude that <mark>the
leadership’s tolerance of the Hyers’ performance and conduct, and its intolerance of Martinelli,
can only be explained by the difference in the loyalty Lindquist perceives the Hyers and
Martinelli show him.</mark>

Ginny, I appreciate the opportunity to serve Pierce County.

<hr>

'54 I do not mean to suggest that the office's response to Ms. Hyer’s performance issues was inappropriate. The
office’s response is relevant only as it compares to the PCPAO’s treatment of Ms. Martinelli and others considered
to be disloyal or “malcontents.”
