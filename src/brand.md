# The Brand Name

Mark Lindquist's campaign for re-election recently emailed supporters to ask for cash.

Some details here merit deeper thought.

Bekka is shocked, _shocked!_, to learn some nonsense about party and views of Mark's opponent.
This kind of pitch appeals to self-identifying Democrats, and introduces doubt about
the unknown challenger.

Then we're asked to _compare this to Mark_. What comes next is a clear definition of
perceptions of the brand:

 - Authentic
 - Trusted
 - bi-partisan
 - Outspoken
 - kept us safe

These 5 claims were probably provided by focus groups or other surveys.
These claims might be false. What matters is they are _believed_.
**The degree to which experiences can challenge these perceptions is the degree to which
this brand can be destroyed.**

This mailer recognizes headlines haven't been smooth for the prosecutor.
An antidote: Attribute bad news to trickery of the opponent.

Lastly, the big brand reinforcement: **proven record on public safety**.

Conclusions: 

 - Information that contradicts the top brand identity includes anything that disputes public safety success, such as homicide rates (up).
 - Information exists that contradicts the view that he's trustworthy or honest, but the brand continues to operate on these claims.
 - _Bi-Partisan_ remains a Lindquist standby, but it's close enough to non-partisanship to be unimportant.
 - _Outspoken_ suggests a bad-boy image, a loud mouth in defense of our safety, a gadfly, willing to take a stand. This brand component is **probably his primary antidote to the severe violations of public records law and other complex malfeasance.**

The prosecutor worked incredibly hard
(spending taxes doing it)
to reinforce these brand traits.
On the one hand, 
the powerful ones can be
contradicted with new information.
On the other hand,
**the degree to which information
can cause people to doubt _everything_
they think they know about
the prosecutor** is the degree to which
we can re-define his brand wholesale.
