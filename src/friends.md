<title>Letter to Friends - Lindquist Bar Complaint</title>

Feb 25th, 2018

Dear Friends,

Today I delivered a letter to the Bar 
Association that reports violations of the 
Rules of Professional Conduct, rules 
established by our state's Supreme Court to 
govern the behavior of all lawyers in our 
state.

I've asked the Bar Association to take action 
in response to a clear pattern of malfescence 
by a powerful elected official in his 
professional capacity.

As you may know, in 2015, I was tried for seven 
felonies, for a speech crime. After a full trial, I was 
acquitted fully of these specious charges.

My life and career in Seattle remain strong due in 
large part to the substantial, ongoing support of my 
family and friends. I could choose to forget about the 
dark times and struggle that accompanied my arrest, 
life as an accused felon, and full trial in a Tacoma 
courtroom. There are many details of the prosecutor's
choices in my case that caused me distress at the 
time. 

But of greater concern, I've come to learn that 
my experience is not an isolated incident; Prosecutor Mark 
Lindquist now has a lengthy and growing record of 
malfescence throughout his tenure, including false 
imprisonment, withholding exculpatory evidence, misusing taxpayer funds, 
making prohibited statements about the accused, and bumbling 
prosecutions of dangerous men. Most disturbingly, 
even as evidence mounts, like a common criminal, he 
denies it all.

I am disurbed that he calls himself a good 
Democrat. I'm also burdened with the knowledge 
that most people accused of serious crimes 
cannot shoulder the burden of a criminal trial, 
even when falsely accused. Facts are the 
beginning and end of a sound prosecution, but 
Mr. Lindquist has shown a very loose and 
opportunistic relationship with the facts.

I've made my full letter to the Bar Association available online.

In addition to this bar complaint, I have also delivered inquiries to the Pierce 
County Prosecuting Attorney's Office that will shed light on the Prosecutor's
use of government media channels, including social media. I wish to better 
understand the substantial investments Mr. Lindquist's office has made in media 
production, and determine whether his office uses these channels in a manner 
consistent with democratic ideals and norms.

I will communicate with you further as these matters are addressed.
I thank you for your continued friendship and support. 

Sincerely,

John Dempsey
